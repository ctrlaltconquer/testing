Java,"Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers ""write once, run anywhere"" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets). The latest version is Java 9, released on September 21, 2017, and is one of the two versions currently supported for free by Oracle. Versions earlier than Java 8 are supported by companies on a commercial basis; e.g. by Oracle back to Java 6 as of October 2017 (while they still ""highly recommend that you uninstall"" pre-Java 8 from at least Windows computers).",Programming Language,1995,James Gosling,https://oracle.com/java/,NA,0,java jav,Yes,//,5550123,85206,Sun Microsystems
JavaScript,"JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded. Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets. Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.",Programming Language,1995,Brendan Eich,NA,https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp,1,js _js bones cjs es es6 frag gs jake javascript jsb jscad jsfl jslib jsm jspre jss jsx mjs njs pac sjs ssjs xsjs xsjslib,Yes,//,5962666,63993,Netscape
C,"C (, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.",Programming Language,1972,Dennis Ritchie,NA,http://www.c4learn.com/c-programming/c-keywords/,2,c cats h idc,Yes,//,3793768,59919,Bell Labs
Python,"Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations.

SQL,"SQL ( ( listen) ESS-kew-EL or  ( listen) SEE-kwəl or  SKWEEL, Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). In comparison to older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM, SQL offers two main advantages: first, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index. Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language, data manipulation language, and data control language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements. SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, ""A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"". Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of such standards, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems without adjustments.",queryLanguage,1974,Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F.

HTML,"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <p>...</p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.",textMarkup,1991,Tim Berners-Lee,NA,NA,5,html hta htm htmlhl inc xht xhtml,Yes,NA,5570873,69531,Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire
C++,"C++ ( pronounced cee plus plus) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (informally known as C++14). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, standard. The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization. The C++17 standard is due in July 2017, with the draft largely implemented by some compilers already, and C++20 is the next planned standard thereafter.

The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.

PHP,"PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 markup, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications. The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge. The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard.

Perl,"Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6. Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including ""Practical Extraction and Reporting Language"". Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another. The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities. In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed ""the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages"" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was also referred to as the ""duct tape that holds the Internet together"", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.",Programming Language,1987,Larry Wall,https://www.perl.org,NA,9,pl al cgi fcgi perl ph plx pm psgi t,Yes,#,491984,13482,Unisys

COBOL,"COBOL (, an acronym for common business-oriented language) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications. COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to as ""the (grand)mother of COBOL"". It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. Intended as a stopgap, the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014. COBOL has an English-like syntax, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like y = x;, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, MOVE x TO y). COBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class. Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text. COBOL has been criticized throughout its life, however, for its verbosity, design process and poor support for structured programming, which resulted in monolithic and incomprehensible programs.",Programming Language,1959,Howard Bromberg and Norman Discount and Vernon Reeves and Jean E.

CSS,"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified. Changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents. The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.",stylesheetLanguage,1996,Håkon Wium Lie,NA,https://examples.p6c.dev/categories/parsers/CSSGrammar.html,19,css,Yes,NA,2881846,45617,Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire
Scala,"Scala ( SKAH-lah) is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java. Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in both languages may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which have proved controversial.

It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6. On platforms other than Linux, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program. Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but ""safer"" (easier to catch software bugs); Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointers and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term ""protocol-oriented programming"" (similar to traits). Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple's platforms and Linux.

Arduino Programming Language,"Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world. Its products are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL), permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits. Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards or breadboards (shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers are typically programmed using a dialect of features from the programming languages C and C++. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Processing language project. The Arduino project started in 2003 as a program for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats and motion detectors. The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the founders of the project used to meet.

PowerShell,"PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. Initially a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core. The former is built on .NET Framework while the latter on .NET Core. In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the file system or registry, which are made available to PowerShell via providers. Third-party developers can develop their own cmdlets and add them to PowerShell. Sets of cmdlets may be combined into scripts. PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of remote Linux systems and network devices. PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications. These applications can then use PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations, including those exposed via the graphical interface. This capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets. Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets. PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help (similar to man pages in Unix shells) accessible via the Get-Help cmdlet. Local help contents can be retrieved from the Internet via Update-Help cmdlet. Alternatively, help from the web can be acquired on a case-by-case basis via the -online switch to Get-Help.",Programming Language,2006,Jeffrey Snover,http://microsoft.com/powershell,NA,27,ps1 psd1 psm1,Yes,#,208708,19576,Microsoft

Wirth had already developed several improvements to this language as part of the ALGOL X proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed separately and released in 1970. A derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985; this was used by Apple Computer and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed into Delphi on the Microsoft Windows platform.

ARM,"ARM, originally Acorn RISC Machine, later Advanced RISC Machine, is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. British company ARM Holdings develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products that implement one of those architectures‍—‌including systems-on-chips (SoC) and systems-on-modules (SoM) that incorporate memory, interfaces, radios, etc. It also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products. Processors that have a RISC architecture typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture (such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers), which improves cost, power consumption, and heat dissipation. These characteristics are desirable for light, portable, battery-powered devices‍—‌including smartphones, laptops and tablet computers, and other embedded systems. For supercomputers, which consume large amounts of electricity, ARM could also be a power-efficient solution. ARM Holdings periodically releases updates to architectures and core designs. All of them support a 32-bit address space (only pre-ARMv3 chips, made before ARM Holdings was formed, as in original Acorn Archimedes, had smaller) and 32-bit arithmetic; instructions for ARM Holdings' cores have 32-bit fixed-length instructions, but later versions of the architecture also support a variable-length instruction set that provides both 32- and 16-bit instructions for improved code density. Some older cores can also provide hardware execution of Java bytecodes. The ARMv8-A architecture, announced in October 2011, adds support for a 64-bit address space and 64-bit arithmetic with its new 32-bit fixed-length instruction set. With over 100 billion ARM processors produced as of 2017, ARM is the most widely used instruction set architecture in terms of quantity produced. Currently, the widely used Cortex cores, older ""classic"" cores, and specialized SecurCore cores variants are available for each of these to include or exclude optional capabilities.",assembly,1985,Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber and Acorn Computers,NA,NA,29,NA,Yes,;,123423,7695,Acorn Computers or Arm Ltd

TypeScript,"TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and compiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript. The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache 2 License. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages.

Lisp,"Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler, and the read–eval–print loop. The name LISP derives from ""LISt Processor"". Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp. The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s-expressions, or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would be called as (f arg1 arg2 arg3).",Programming Language,1958,John McCarthy,NA,NA,32,NA,NA,NA,61481,303,Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Node.js,"Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a ""JavaScript everywhere"" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts. Though .js is the conventional filename extension for JavaScript code, the name ""Node.js"" does not refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product.

It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp. The Scheme language is standardized in the official IEEE standard and a de facto standard called the Revisedn Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (RnRS). The most widely implemented standard is R5RS (1998); a new standard, R6RS, was ratified in 2007. Scheme has a diverse user base due to its compactness and elegance, but its minimalist philosophy has also caused wide divergence between practical implementations, so much that the Scheme Steering Committee calls it ""the world's most unportable programming language"" and ""a family of dialects"" rather than a single language.",Programming Language,1970,Guy Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman,http://www.scheme-reports.org/,NA,49,scm sch sld sls sps ss,Yes,;,3796,1174,https://community.scheme.org/

Modula-2,"Modula-2 is a computer programming language designed and developed between 1977 and 1985 by Niklaus Wirth at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) as a revision of Pascal to serve as the sole programming language for the operating system and application software for the personal workstation Lilith. The principal concepts were: The module as a compilation unit for separate compilation The coroutine as the basic building block for concurrent processes Types and procedures that allow access to machine-specific data. Modula-2 was viewed by Niklaus Wirth as a successor to his earlier programming languages Pascal and Modula. The language design was also influenced by the Mesa language and the new programming possibilities of the early personal computer Xerox Alto, both from Xerox, that Wirth saw during his 1976 sabbatical year at Xerox PARC.

Tcl,"Tcl (pronounced ""tickle"" or tee cee ell, ) is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful. Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition. Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It is commonly used embedded into C applications, for rapid prototyping, scripted applications, GUIs, and testing. Tcl interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Tcl code to run on a wide variety of systems. Because Tcl is a very compact language, it is used on embedded systems platforms, both in its full form and in several other small-footprint versions. The popular combination of Tcl with the Tk extension is referred to as Tcl/Tk, and enables building a graphical user interface (GUI) natively in Tcl.

VBA,"Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of Microsoft's event-driven programming language Visual Basic 6, which was discontinued in 2008, and its associated integrated development environment (IDE). Although Visual Basic is no longer supported or updated by Microsoft, VBA itself got upgraded in 2010 with the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications 7 in Microsoft Office applications. Visual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes and accessing Windows API and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word's WordBasic. It can be used to control many aspects of the host application, including manipulating user interface features, such as menus and toolbars, and working with custom user forms or dialog boxes. As its name suggests, VBA is closely related to Visual Basic and uses the Visual Basic Runtime Library. However, VBA code normally can only run within a host application, rather than as a standalone program. VBA can, however, control one application from another using OLE Automation. For example, VBA can automatically create a Microsoft Word report from Microsoft Excel data that Excel collects automatically from polled sensors. VBA can use, but not create, ActiveX/COM DLLs, and later versions add support for class modules. VBA is built into most Microsoft Office applications, including Office for Mac OS X (except version 2008), and other Microsoft applications, including Microsoft MapPoint and Microsoft Visio.

Regular Expressions,"A regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for ""find"" or ""find and replace"" operations on strings. The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language. The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. Since the 1980s, different syntaxes for writing regular expressions exist, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax. Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis.

BASIC,"BASIC (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, United States. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn. Versions of BASIC became widespread on microcomputers in the mid-1970s and 1980s. Microcomputers usually shipped with BASIC, often in the machine's firmware. Having an easy-to-learn language on these early personal computers allowed small business owners, professionals, hobbyists, and consultants to develop custom software on computers they could afford. In the 2010s, BASIC was popular in many computing dialects and in new languages influenced by BASIC, such as Microsoft's Visual Basic.",Programming Language,1964,John G. Kemeny and Thomas E.

awk,"AWK is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports. The language extensively uses the string datatype, associative arrays (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and regular expressions. While AWK has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one-liner programs, the language is Turing-complete, and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs. AWK was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s, and its name is derived from the surnames of its authors—Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. The acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird auk (which acts as an emblem of the language such as on The AWK Programming Language book cover – the book is often referred to by the abbreviation TAPL).

Delphi,"Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment (IDE) for desktop, mobile, web, and console applications. It's also an event driven language. Delphi's compilers use their own Object Pascal dialect of Pascal and generate native code for several platforms: Windows (x86 and x64), OS X (32-bit only), iOS (32 and 64-bit), Android and Linux (64-bit Intel). Delphi, part of RAD Studio, includes a code editor with Code Insight (code completion), Error Insight (real-time error-checking), and other features; refactoring; a visual forms designer for both VCL (native Windows) and FMX (cross-platform, partially native per platform); an integrated debugger for all platforms including mobile; source control (SVN, git, and Mercurial); and support for third-party plugins. It has strong database support. It is not unusual for a Delphi project of a million lines to compile in a few seconds – one benchmark gave 170,000 lines per second. It is under active development, with (in 2016) releases every six months, with new platforms being added approximately every second release. Delphi was originally developed by Borland as a rapid application development tool for Windows as the successor of Turbo Pascal. Delphi added full object-orientation to the existing language, and since then the language has grown and supports many other modern language features, including generics and anonymous methods, as well as unusual features such as inbuilt string types and native COM support. Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, share many core components, notably the IDE, the Visual Component Library (VCL), and much of the RTL, and are compatible with each other: C++Builder 6 and onwards can consume Delphi-language files and C++ in the one project, and packages compiled with C++Builder written in C++ can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as RAD Studio. RAD Studio is a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, and can be purchased with either or both. In 2006, Borland’s developer tools section was transferred from Borland to a wholly owned subsidiary known as CodeGear, which was sold to Embarcadero Technologies in 2008.

YAML,"YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored (e.g. debugging output) or transmitted (e.g. document headers). YAML targets many of the same communications applications as XML, but has taken a more minimal approach which intentionally breaks compatibility with SGML. YAML 1.2 is a superset of JSON, another minimalist data serialization format where braces and brackets are used instead of indentation. Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also known as hashes or dictionaries). These data types are based on the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level programming languages share very similar concepts. YAML supports both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses [] for lists and {} for hashes. The colon-centered syntax used to express key-value pairs is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in RFC 0822, and the document separator ""---"" is borrowed from MIME (RFC 2045). Escape sequences are reused from C, and whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired from HTML. Lists and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases (similar to XML in SOAP). YAML is intended to be read and written in streams, a feature inspired by SAX. Support for reading and writing YAML is available for several programming languages. Some source code editors such as Emacs and various integrated development environments have features that make editing YAML easier, such as folding up nested structures or automatically highlighting syntax errors.",dataNotation,2001,NA,http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Introduction,NA,67,yml mir reek rviz sublime-syntax syntax yaml yaml-tmlanguage yamlsed ymlmysql,Yes,#,13981,61,NA

REST,"Representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful web services are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant Web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other forms of Web services exist, which expose their own arbitrary sets of operations such as WSDL and SOAP. ""Web resources"" were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or files identified by their URLs, but today they have a much more generic and abstract definition encompassing every thing or entity that can be identified, named, addressed or handled, in any way whatsoever, on the Web. In a RESTful Web service, requests made to a resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in XML, HTML, JSON or some other defined format. The response may confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource, and it may provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources. Using HTTP, as is most common, the kind of operations available include those predefined by the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and so on. By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running. The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. Fielding's dissertation explained the REST principles were known as the ""HTTP object model"" beginning in 1994, and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) standards. The term is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: it is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting links, such as /user/tom, and operations such as GET or DELETE (state transitions), resulting in the next resource (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user for their use.",protocol,1996,NA,NA,NA,77,NA,NA,NA,24190,26215,"University of California, Irvine"

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit-based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term ""x86"" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in ""86"", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. Many additions and extensions have been added to the x86 instruction set over the years, almost consistently with full backward compatibility. The architecture has been implemented in processors from Intel, Cyrix, AMD, VIA and many other companies; there are also open implementations, such as the Zet SoC platform.

D,"The D programming language is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright of Digital Mars and released in 2001. Bright was joined in the design and development effort in 2007 by Andrei Alexandrescu. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is a distinct language, having redesigned some core C++ features while also taking inspiration from other languages, notably Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel. D's design goals attempt to combine the performance and safety of compiled languages with the expressive power of modern dynamic languages. Idiomatic D code is commonly as fast as equivalent C++ code, while being shorter and memory-safe. Type inference, automatic memory management and syntactic sugar for common types allow faster development, while bounds checking, design by contract features and a concurrency-aware type system help reduce the occurrence of bugs.",Programming Language,2001,Walter Bright and Andrei Alexandrescu,https://dlang.org,NA,80,d di,Yes,//,6311,0,Digital Mars
FTP,"The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS). SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is sometimes also used instead; it is technologically different. The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications, such as web page editors.",protocol,1971,NA,NA,NA,81,NA,NA,NA,13916,0,Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Common Lisp,"Common Lisp (CL) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in ANSI standard document ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (R2004) (formerly X3.226-1994 (R1999)). The Common Lisp HyperSpec, a hyperlinked HTML version, has been derived from the ANSI Common Lisp standard. The Common Lisp language was developed as a standardized and improved successor of Maclisp. By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp), Spice Lisp, NIL and S-1 Lisp. Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products. Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports a combination of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms. As a dynamic programming language, it facilitates evolutionary and incremental software development, with iterative compilation into efficient run-time programs. This incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application. It also supports optional type annotation and casting, which can be added as necessary at the later profiling and optimization stages, to permit the compiler to generate more efficient code. For instance, fixnum can hold an unboxed integer in a range supported by the hardware and implementation, permitting more efficient arithmetic than on big integers or arbitrary precision types. Similarly, the compiler can be told on a per-module or per-function basis which type safety level is wanted, using optimize declarations. Common Lisp includes CLOS, an object system that supports multimethods and method combinations. It is often implemented with a Metaobject Protocol. Common Lisp is extensible through standard features such as Lisp macros (code transformations) and reader macros (input parsers for characters). Common Lisp provides some backwards compatibility to Maclisp and to John McCarthy's original Lisp. This allows older Lisp software to be ported to Common Lisp.",Programming Language,1984,Scott Fahlman and Richard P. Gabriel and David A.

LaTeX,"LaTeX (IPA: , LAH-tekh, also pronounced as , LAY-tekh, a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX. LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Tamil, Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language. LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system or as an intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies. Like TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but from early in its development it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese. LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In short, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents. Because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies. LaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. The current version is LaTeX2e (stylised as LaTeX2ε). LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).",textMarkup,1985,NA,http://latex-project.org/,NA,87,NA,Yes,%,7721,0,https://www.latex-project.org/about/team/

TLS,"Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network. Several versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, Internet faxing, instant messaging, and Voice over IP (VoIP). Websites are able to use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers. The Transport Layer Security protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating computer applications. When secured by TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) have one or more of the following properties: The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared secret negotiated at the start of the session (see § TLS handshake). The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted (see § Algorithm below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected). The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using public-key cryptography. This authentication can be made optional, but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically the server). The connection ensures integrity because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during transmission. In addition to the properties above, careful configuration of TLS can provide additional privacy-related properties such as forward secrecy, ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys cannot be used to decrypt any TLS communications recorded in the past. TLS supports many different methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data, and authenticating message integrity (see § Algorithm below). As a result, secure configuration of TLS involves many configurable parameters, and not all choices provide all of the privacy-related properties described in the list above (see the § Key exchange (authentication), § Cipher security, and § Data integrity tables). Attempts have been made to subvert aspects of the communications security that TLS seeks to provide and the protocol has been revised several times to address these security threats (see § Security). Developers of web browsers have also revised their products to defend against potential security weaknesses after these were discovered (see TLS/SSL support history of web browsers). The TLS protocol comprises two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols. TLS is a proposed Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard, first defined in 1999 and updated in RFC 5246 (August 2008) and RFC 6176 (March 2011). It builds on the earlier SSL specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by Netscape Communications for adding the HTTPS protocol to their Navigator web browser.",protocol,1999,NA,NA,NA,89,NA,NA,NA,24595,0,NA

Red,"Red is a computer programming language. Red was made to overcome the limitations of the programming language Rebol. Introduced in 2011 by Nenad Rakocevic, Red is both an imperative and functional programming language. Its syntax and general usage overlaps that of the interpreted Rebol language (which was introduced in 1997). The implementation choices of Red intend to create a full stack programming language: Red can be used for extremely high-level programming (DSLs and GUIs) as well as low-level programming (operating systems and device drivers). Key to the approach is that the language has two parts: Red/System and Red. Red/System is similar to C, but packaged into a Rebol lexical structure –  for example, one would write if x > y [print ""Hello""] instead of if (x > y) {printf(""Hello\n"");}. Red is a homoiconic language capable of meta-programming, with semantics similar to Rebol's. Red's runtime library is written in Red/System, and uses a hybrid approach: it compiles what it can deduce statically and uses an embedded interpreter otherwise. The project roadmap includes a just-in-time compiler for cases in between, but this has not yet been implemented. Red seeks to remain independent of any other toolchain; it does its own code generation.

Rexx,"Rexx (Restructured Extended Executor) is an interpreted programming language developed at IBM by Mike Cowlishaw. It is a structured, high-level programming language designed for ease of learning and reading. Proprietary and open source REXX interpreters exist for a wide range of computing platforms; compilers exist for IBM mainframe computers. Rexx is used as a scripting and macro language, and is often used for processing data and text and generating reports; these similarities with Perl mean that Rexx works well in Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming and it is indeed used for this purpose. Rexx is the primary scripting language in some operating systems, e.g. OS/2, MVS, VM, AmigaOS, and is also used as an internal macro language in some other software, such as KEDIT, THE and the ZOC terminal emulator. Additionally, the Rexx language can be used for scripting and macros in any program that uses Windows Scripting Host ActiveX scripting engines languages (e.g. VBScript and JScript) if one of the Rexx engines is installed. Rexx is supplied with VM/SP on up, TSO/E Version 2 on up, OS/2 (1.3 and later, where it is officially named Procedures Language/2), AmigaOS Version 2 on up, PC DOS (7.0 or 2000), and Windows NT 4.0 (Resource Kit: Regina). REXX scripts for OS/2 share the filename extension .cmd with other scripting languages, and the first line of the script specifies the interpreter to be used. REXX macros for REXX-aware applications use extensions determined by the application. In the late 1980s Rexx became the common scripting language for IBM Systems Application Architecture, where it was renamed ""SAA Procedure Language REXX."" A Rexx script or command is sometimes referred to as an EXEC in a nod to Rexx's role as a replacement for the older EXEC command language on CP/CMS and VM/370 and EXEC 2 command language on VM/SP.",Programming Language,1979,Mike Cowlishaw,NA,NA,115,rexx pprx rex,Yes,NA,435,40,IBM
UDP,"In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels or data paths. UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose. UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.",protocol,1980,NA,NA,NA,116,NA,NA,NA,8860,35,NA

Although not an acronym, the language's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH, following the customary usage during its earlier years. A procedural programming language without type checking, Forth features both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution. Some Forth implementations (usually early versions or those written to be extremely portable) compile threaded code, but many implementations today generate optimized machine code like other language compilers. Forth is used in the Open Firmware boot loader, in space applications, such as the Philae spacecraft and other embedded systems which involve interaction with hardware. The bestselling 1986 DOS game Starflight, from Electronic Arts, was written with a custom Forth.

MIPS architecture,"MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer Systems). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; as well as five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and 64-bit implementations, respectively). As of April 2017, the current version is MIPS32/64 Release 6. MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS I–V by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the user mode architecture. Several optional extensions are also available, including MIPS-3D which is a simple set of floating-point SIMD instructions dedicated to common 3D tasks, MDMX (MaDMaX) which is a more extensive integer SIMD instruction set using the 64-bit floating-point registers, MIPS16e which adds compression to the instruction stream to make programs take up less room, and MIPS MT, which adds multithreading capability. Computer architecture courses in universities and technical schools often study the MIPS architecture. The architecture greatly influenced later RISC architectures such as Alpha. As of April 2017, MIPS processors are used in embedded systems such as residential gateways and routers. Originally, MIPS was designed for general-purpose computing, and during the 1980s and 1990s, MIPS processors for personal, workstation, and server computers were used by many companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation, MIPS Computer Systems, NEC, Pyramid Technology, SiCortex, Siemens Nixdorf, Silicon Graphics, and Tandem Computers. Historically, video game consoles such as the Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable use MIPS processors. MIPS processors also used to be popular in supercomputers during the 1990s, but all such systems have dropped off the TOP500 list. These uses were complemented by embedded applications at first, but during the 1990s, MIPS became a major presence in the embedded processor market, and by the 2000s, most MIPS processors were for these applications. In the mid- to late-1990s, it was estimated that one in three RISC microprocessors produced was a MIPS processor. MIPS is a modular architecture supporting up to four coprocessors (CP0/1/2/3). In MIPS terminology, CP0 is the System Control Coprocessor (an essential part of the processor that is implementation-defined in MIPS I–V), CP1 is an optional floating-point unit (FPU) and CP2/3 are optional implementation-defined coprocessors (MIPS III removed CP3 and reused its opcodes for other purposes). For example, in the PlayStation video game console, CP2 is the Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE), which accelerates the processing of geometry in 3D computer graphics.",isa,1985,NA,NA,NA,122,NA,Yes,#,5145,12,MIPS Technologies && Imagination Technologies
ML,"ML ('Meta Language') is a general-purpose functional programming language. It has roots in Lisp, and has been characterized as ""Lisp with types"". It is known for its use of the polymorphic Hindley–Milner type system, which automatically assigns the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations, and ensures type safety – there is a formal proof that a well-typed ML program does not cause runtime type errors. ML provides pattern matching for function arguments, garbage collection, imperative programming, call-by-value and currying. It is used heavily in programming language research and is one of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics. Its types and pattern matching make it well-suited and commonly used to operate on other formal languages, such as in compiler writing, automated theorem proving and formal verification.",Programming Language,1973,Robin Milner,NA,NA,123,NA,NA,NA,2725,6,University of Edinburgh
Lasso,"Lasso is an application server and server management interface used to develop internet applications and is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. Originally a web datasource connection tool, for Filemaker and later included in Apple Computer's FileMaker 4.0 and Claris Homepage as CDML, it has since evolved into a complex language used to develop and serve large-scale internet applications and web pages. Lasso includes a simple template system allowing code to control generation of HTML and other content types. Lasso is object-oriented and every value is an object. It also supports procedural programming through unbound methods. The language uses traits and multiple dispatch extensively. Lasso has a dynamic type system, where objects can be loaded and augmented at runtime, automatic memory management, a comprehensive standard library, and three compiling methodologies: dynamic (comparable to PHP-Python), just-in-time compilation (comparable to Java or .NET Framework), and pre-compiled (comparable to C). Lasso also supports Query Expressions, allowing elements within arrays and other types of sequences to be iterated, filtered, and manipulated using a natural language syntax similar to SQL. Lasso includes full Unicode character support in the standard string object, allowing it to serve and support multi-byte characters such as Japanese and Swedish, and supports transparent UTF-8 conversion when writing string data to the network or file system. Lasso is often used as a scripting language, and also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Lasso code can be packaged into standalone executable programs called ""LassoApps"", in which folder structures are compiled into single files. The Lasso Server application server runs as a system service and receives requests from the web server through FastCGI. It then hands the request off to the appropriate Lasso Instance, which formulates the response. Multiple individual instances are supported, allowing one server to handle multiple sites, each as separate processes. The server uses a high performance IO-based green threading system designed for multi-core systems. Lasso can be compared to the server-side scripting languages PHP and Python, ColdFusion, Ruby, etc. Free for development, Lasso allows partial access to its source code, allowing developers to add or change major components of the language (for example, Ke Carlton's DS implementation of the Lasso Inline).

Protocol Buffers,"Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data. Google developed Protocol Buffers for use internally and has provided a code generator for multiple languages under an open source license (see below). The design goals for Protocol Buffers emphasized simplicity and performance. In particular, it was designed to be smaller and faster than XML. Protocol Buffers is widely used at Google for storing and interchanging all kinds of structured information. The method serves as a basis for a custom remote procedure call (RPC) system that is used for nearly all inter-machine communication at Google. Protocol Buffers are similar to the Apache Thrift (used by Facebook) or Microsoft Bond protocols, offering as well a concrete RPC protocol stack to use for defined services called gRPC. A software developer defines data structures (called messages) and services in a proto definition file (.proto) and compiles it with protoc. This compilation generates code that can be invoked by a sender or recipient of these data structures. For example, example.proto will produce example.pb.cc and example.pb.h, which will define C++ classes for each message and service that example.proto defines. Canonically, messages are serialized into a binary wire format which is compact, forward- and backward-compatible, but not self-describing (that is, there is no way to tell the names, meaning, or full datatypes of fields without an external specification). There is no defined way to include or refer to such an external specification (schema) within a Protocol Buffers file. The officially supported implementation includes an ASCII serialization format, but this format—though self-describing—loses the forward- and backward-compatibility behavior, and is thus not a good choice for applications other than debugging. Though the primary purpose of Protocol Buffers is to facilitate network communication, its simplicity and speed make Protocol Buffers an alternative to data-centric C++ classes and structs, especially where interoperability with other languages or systems might be needed in the future.",idl,2008,NA,https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/,NA,135,proto,Yes,//,2416,94,Google

Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and features garbage collection. Also other forms of subtyping (besides inheriting subclasses) were introduced in Simula derivatives. Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. As its name suggests, Simula was designed for doing simulations, and the needs of that domain provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today. Simula has been used in a wide range of applications such as simulating VLSI designs, process modeling, protocols, algorithms, and other applications such as typesetting, computer graphics, and education. The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in C++, Object Pascal, Java, C# and several other languages.

Logo,"Logo is an educational programming language, designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon. ""Logo"" is not an acronym. It was derived from the Greek logos meaning word or ""thought"" by Feurzeig, to distinguish itself from other programming languages that were primarily numbers, not graphics or logic, oriented. A general-purpose language, Logo is widely known for its use of turtle graphics, in which commands for movement and drawing produced line graphics either on screen or with a small robot called a turtle. The language was conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp and only later to enable what Papert called ""body-syntonic reasoning"", where students could understand, predict and reason about the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. There are substantial differences among the many dialects of Logo, and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle-graphics programs that call themselves Logo. Logo is a multi-paradigm adaptation and dialect of Lisp, a functional programming language. There is no standard Logo, but UCBLogo has the best facilities for handling lists, files, I/O, and recursion in scripts, and can be used to teach all computer science concepts, as UC Berkeley lecturer Brian Harvey did in his Computer Science Logo Style trilogy.

Dylan,"Dylan  is a multi-paradigm programming language that includes support for functional and object-oriented programming, and is dynamic and reflective while providing a programming model designed to support efficient machine code generation, including fine-grained control over dynamic and static behaviors. It was created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer. A concise and thorough overview of the language may be found in the Dylan Reference Manual. Dylan derives from Scheme and Common Lisp and adds an integrated object system derived from the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). In Dylan, all values (including numbers, characters, functions, and classes) are first-class objects. Dylan supports multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword arguments, object introspection, pattern-based syntax extension macros, and many other advanced features. Programs can express fine-grained control over dynamism, admitting programs that occupy a continuum between dynamic and static programming and supporting evolutionary development (allowing for rapid prototyping followed by incremental refinement and optimization). Dylan's main design goal is to be a dynamic language well-suited for developing commercial software. Dylan attempts to address potential performance issues by introducing ""natural"" limits to the full flexibility of Lisp systems, allowing the compiler to clearly understand compilable units (i.e., libraries). Although deriving much of its semantics from Scheme and other Lisps—some implementations were in fact initially built within existing Lisp systems—Dylan has an ALGOL-like syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax.",Programming Language,1992,NA,http://opendylan.org,NA,149,dylan dyl intr lid,Yes,//,636,0,Apple

GAME,"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). Games are sometimes played purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.

OWL,"The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects. Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (typically monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand are meant to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases. The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) XML standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest. In October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009. This new version, called OWL 2, soon found its way into semantic editors such as Protégé and semantic reasoners such as Pellet, RacerPro, FaCT++ and HermiT. The OWL family contains many species, serializations, syntaxes and specifications with similar names. OWL and OWL2 are used to refer to the 2004 and 2009 specifications, respectively.

Algol,"ALGOL (short for Algorithmic Language) is a family of imperative computer programming languages, originally developed in the mid-1950s, which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the ACM in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years. In the sense that the syntax of most modern languages is ""Algol-like"", it was arguably the most influential of the four high-level programming languages among which it was roughly contemporary: FORTRAN, Lisp, and COBOL. It was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with FORTRAN and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages, including PL/I, Simula, BCPL, B, Pascal, and C. ALGOL introduced code blocks and the begin…end pairs for delimiting them. It was also the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope. Moreover, it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the Algol 60 Report introduced Backus–Naur form, a principal formal grammar notation for language design. There were three major specifications, named after the year they were first published: ALGOL 58 – originally proposed to be called IAL, for International Algebraic Language. ALGOL 60 – first implemented as X1 ALGOL 60 in mid-1960. Revised 1963. ALGOL 68 – introduced new elements including flexible arrays, slices, parallelism, operator identification. Revised 1973. Niklaus Wirth based his own ALGOL W on ALGOL 60 before developing Pascal. ALGOL-W was based on the proposal for the next generation ALGOL, but the ALGOL 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced, rather than a cleaned, simplified ALGOL 60. ALGOL 68 is substantially different from ALGOL 60 and was not well received, so that in general ""Algol"" means ALGOL 60 and dialects thereof.",Programming Language,1958,NA,NA,NA,160,NA,NA,NA,1635,0,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

Hamblin in the mid-1950s.During the 1970s and 1980s, Hewlett-Packard used RPN in all of their desktop and hand-held calculators, and continued to use it in some into the 2010's.  In computer science, reverse Polish notation is used in stack-oriented programming languages such as Forth and PostScript. Most of what follows is about binary operators.

SPARC,"SPARC, for Scalable Processor Architecture, is a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Its design was strongly influenced by the experimental Berkeley RISC system developed in the early 1980s. First released in 1987, SPARC was one of the most successful early commercial RISC systems, and its success led to the introduction of similar RISC designs from a number of vendors through the 1980s and 90s. The first implementation of the original 32-bit architecture (SPARC V7) was used in Sun's Sun-4 workstation and server systems, replacing their earlier Sun-3 systems based on the Motorola 68000 series of processors. SPARC V8 added a number of improvements that were part of the SuperSPARC series of processors released in 1992. SPARC V9, released in 1993, introduced a 64-bit architecture and was first released in Sun's UltraSPARC processors in 1995. Later, SPARC processors were used in SMP and CC-NUMA servers produced by Sun, Solbourne and Fujitsu, among others. The design was turned over to the SPARC International trade group in 1989, and since then its architecture has been developed by its members. SPARC International is also responsible for licensing and promoting the SPARC architecture, managing SPARC trademarks (including SPARC, which it owns), and providing conformance testing. SPARC International was intended to grow the SPARC architecture to create a larger ecosystem; SPARC has been licensed to several manufacturers, including Atmel, Bipolar Integrated Technology, Cypress Semiconductor, Fujitsu, Matsushita and Texas Instruments.

MUMPS,"MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), or M, is a general-purpose computer programming language that provides ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable) transaction processing. Its differentiating feature is its ""built-in"" database, enabling high-level access to disk storage using simple symbolic program variables and subscripted arrays, similar to the variables used by most languages to access main memory. The M database is a key-value database engine optimized for high-throughput transaction processing. As such it is in the class of ""schema-less"", ""schema-free,"" or NoSQL databases. Internally, M stores data in multidimensional hierarchical sparse arrays (also known as key-value nodes, sub-trees, or associative memory). Each array may have up to 32 subscripts, or dimensions. A scalar can be thought of as an array element with zero subscripts. Nodes with varying numbers of subscripts (including one node with no subscripts) can freely co-exist in the same array. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the M language is the notion that the database is accessed through variables, rather than queries or retrievals. This means that accessing volatile memory and non-volatile storage use the same basic syntax, enabling a function to work on either local (volatile) or global (non-volatile) variables. Practically, this provides for extremely high performance data access. Originally designed in 1966 for the healthcare industry, M continues to be used today by many large hospitals and banks to provide high-throughput transaction data processing.",Programming Language,1966,Neil Pappalardo,NA,NA,180,mumps m,Yes,;,1345,0,MUMPS Development Committee

AutoIt,"AutoIt  is a freeware automation language for Microsoft Windows. In its earliest release, the software was primarily intended to create automation scripts (sometimes called macros) for Microsoft Windows programs but has since grown to include enhancements in both programming language design and overall functionality. While the scripting language in AutoIt 1 and 2 was statement-driven, designed primarily for simulating user interaction, from version 3 onwards the AutoIt syntax is similar to that found in the BASIC family of languages. In this form, AutoIt is a general-purpose, third-generation programming language with a classical data model and a variant data type that can store several types of data, including arrays. While version 1 and 2 were compatible with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Windows 7, support for operating systems older than Windows 2000 was discontinued with the release of v3.3.0 in December 2008. Currently AutoIt is also compatible with Windows 2008, Windows 8, Windows 2012, Windows 10, and the minimal requirement is Windows XP SP3. An AutoIt automation script can be converted into a compressed, stand-alone executable which can be run on computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed. A wide range of function libraries (known as UDFs, or ""User Defined Functions"") are also included as standard or are available from the website to add specialized functionality. AutoIt is also distributed with an IDE based on the free SciTE editor.

Emacs Lisp,"Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs). It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C (as is the Lisp interpreter itself). Emacs Lisp is also referred to as Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name. Users of Emacs commonly write Emacs Lisp code to customize and extend Emacs. Other options include the ""Customize"" feature that's been in GNU Emacs since version 20. Itself written in Emacs Lisp, Customize provides a set of preferences pages allowing the user to set options and preview their effect in the running Emacs session. When the user saves their changes, Customize simply writes the necessary Emacs Lisp code to the user's config file, which can be set to a special file that only Customize uses, to avoid the possibility of messing up the users own file. Emacs Lisp can also function as a scripting language, much like the Unix Bourne shell or Perl, by calling Emacs in ""batch mode"". In this way it may be called from the command line or via an executable file, and its editing functions, such as buffers and movement commands are available to the program just as in the normal mode. No user interface is presented when Emacs is started in batch mode; it simply executes the passed-in script and exits, displaying any output from the script.",Programming Language,1985,Richard Stallman,NA,NA,184,el emacs emacsdesktop,Yes,;,1645,0,GNU Project
XAML,"Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML  (listen)) is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used for initializing structured values and objects. It is available under Microsoft's Open Specification Promise. The acronym originally stood for Extensible Avalon Markup Language, Avalon being the code-name for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).XAML is used extensively in .NET Framework 3.0 & .NET Framework 4.0 technologies, particularly Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Runtime XAML Framework and Windows Store apps. In WPF, XAML forms a user interface markup language to define UI elements, data binding, events, and other features. In WF, workflows can be defined using XAML. XAML can also be used in Silverlight applications, Windows Phone apps and Windows Store apps. XAML elements map directly to Common Language Runtime object instances, while XAML attributes map to Common Language Runtime properties and events on those objects. XAML files can be created and edited with visual design tools like Microsoft Expression Blend, Microsoft Visual Studio, and the hostable Windows Workflow Foundation visual designer. They can also be created and edited with a standard text editor, a code editor like XAMLPad, or a graphical editor like Vector Architect. Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed using a more traditional .NET language, such as C# or Visual Basic .NET. However, a key aspect of the technology is the reduced complexity needed for tools to process XAML, because it is based on XML. Consequently, a variety of products are emerging, particularly in the WPF space, which create XAML-based applications. As XAML is simply based on XML, developers and designers are able to share and edit content freely amongst themselves without requiring compilation. XAML also benefits from being a declarative definition of the UI rather than procedural code to generate it.",xmlFormat,2008,NA,NA,NA,185,NA,NA,NA,202885,0,NA

J,"The J programming language, developed in the early 1990s by Kenneth E. Iverson and Roger Hui, is a synthesis of APL (also by Iverson) and the FP and FL function-level languages created by John Backus. To avoid repeating the APL special-character problem, J uses only the basic ASCII character set, resorting to the use of the dot and colon as inflections to form short words similar to digraphs. Most such ""primary"" (or ""primitive"") J words serve as mathematical symbols, with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available. Also, many characters which in other languages often must be paired (such as [] {} """" `` or <>) are treated by J as stand-alone words or, when inflected, as single-character roots of multi-character words. J is a very terse array programming language, and is most suited to mathematical and statistical programming, especially when performing operations on matrices. It has also been used in extreme programming and network performance analysis. Like the original FP/FL languages, J supports function-level programming via its tacit programming features. Unlike most languages that support object-oriented programming, J's flexible hierarchical namespace scheme (where every name exists in a specific locale) can be effectively used as a framework for both class-based and prototype-based object-oriented programming. Since March 2011, J is free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license. One may also purchase source under a negotiated license.",Programming Language,1990,Kenneth E.

Vala,"Vala is an object-oriented programming language with a self-hosting compiler that generates C code and uses the GObject system. Vala is syntactically similar to C# and includes several features such as: anonymous functions, signals, properties, generics, assisted memory management, exception handling, type inference, and foreach statements. Its developers Jürg Billeter and Raffaele Sandrini aim to bring these features to the plain C runtime with little overhead and no special runtime support by targeting the GObject object system. Rather than compiling directly to machine code or assembly language, it compiles to a lower level intermediate language. It source-to-source compiles to C, which is then compiled with a C compiler for a given platform, such as GCC. For memory management, the GObject system provides reference counting. In C, a programmer must manually manage adding and removing references, but in Vala, managing such reference counts is automated if a programmer uses the language's built-in reference types rather than plain pointers. Using functionality from native code libraries requires writing vapi files, defining the library interfacing. Writing these interface definitions is well-documented for C libraries, especially when based on GObject. However, C++ libraries are not supported. Vapi files are provided for a large portion of the GNOME platform, including GTK+.

Qt Quick is often used for mobile applications where touch input, fluid animations (60 FPS) and user experience are crucial. QML is also used with Qt3D to describe a 3D scene and a ""frame graph"" rendering methodology. A QML document describes a hierarchical object tree. QML modules shipped with Qt include primitive graphical building blocks (e.g., Rectangle, Image), modeling components (e.g., FolderListModel, XmlListModel), behavioral components (e.g., TapHandler, DragHandler, State, Transition, Animation), and more complex controls (e.g., Button, Slider, Drawer, Menu). These elements can be combined to build components ranging in complexity from simple buttons and sliders, to complete internet-enabled programs. QML elements can be augmented by standard JavaScript both inline and via included .js files.  Elements can also be seamlessly integrated and extended by C++ components using the Qt framework. QML is the language; its JavaScript runtime is the custom V4 engine, since Qt 5.2; and Qt Quick is the 2D scene graph and the UI framework based on it.

SI,"The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, from the French Système international (d'unités)) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability. The motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world. The International System of Units has been adopted by all developed countries except the United States.",notation,1960,NA,NA,NA,223,NA,NA,NA,14430,0,NA

S-expressions,"In computing, s-expressions, sexprs or sexps (for ""symbolic expression"") are a notation for nested list (tree-structured) data, invented for and popularized by the programming language Lisp, which uses them for source code as well as data. In the usual parenthesized syntax of Lisp, an s-expression is classically defined as an atom, or an expression of the form (x . y) where x and y are s-expressions. The second, recursive part of the definition represents an ordered pair so that s-exprs are effectively binary trees. The definition of an atom varies per context; in the original definition by John McCarthy, it was assumed that there existed ""an infinite set of distinguishable atomic symbols"" represented as ""strings of capital Latin letters and digits with single embedded blanks"" (i.e., character string and numeric literals). Most modern sexpr notations in addition use an abbreviated notation to represent lists in s-expressions, so that (x y z) stands for (x . (y . (z . NIL))) where NIL is the special end-of-list object (alternatively written (), which is the only representation in Scheme). In the Lisp family of programming languages, s-expressions are used to represent both source code and data. Other uses of S-expressions are in Lisp-derived languages such as DSSSL, and as mark-up in communications protocols like IMAP and John McCarthy's CBCL. The details of the syntax and supported data types vary in the different languages, but the most common feature among these languages is the use of S-expressions and prefix notation.",dataNotation,1960,NA,NA,https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/components/sexpr/,233,NA,NA,NA,1575,0,NA

SNOBOL,"SNOBOL (StriNg Oriented and symBOlic Language) is a series of computer programming languages developed between 1962 and 1967 at AT&T Bell Laboratories by David J. Farber, Ralph E. Griswold and Ivan P. Polonsky, culminating in SNOBOL4. It was one of a number of text-string-oriented languages developed during the 1950s and 1960s; others included COMIT and TRAC. SNOBOL4 stands apart from most programming languages of its era by having patterns as a first-class data type (i.e. a data type whose values can be manipulated in all ways permitted to any other data type in the programming language) and by providing operators for pattern concatenation and alternation. In later object-oriented languages, such as JavaScript, patterns are a type of object, and admit various manipulations. Further, strings generated during execution can be treated as programs and executed (as in the eval function of other languages). SNOBOL4 was quite widely taught in larger US universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s as a text manipulation language in the humanities. In the 1980s and 1990s its use faded as newer languages such as AWK and Perl made string manipulation by means of regular expressions fashionable. SNOBOL4 patterns subsume BNF grammars, which are equivalent to context-free grammars and more powerful than regular expressions. The ""regular expressions"" in current versions of AWK and Perl are in fact extensions of regular expressions in the traditional sense, but regular expressions, unlike SNOBOL4 patterns, are not recursive, which gives a distinct computational advantage to SNOBOL4 patterns. (Recursive expressions did appear in Perl 5.10, though, released in December 2007.) One of the designers of SNOBOL, Ralph Griswold, designed successors to SNOBOL4 called SL5 and Icon, which combined the backtracking of SNOBOL4 pattern matching with more standard ALGOL-like structuring, as well as adding some features of their own.",Programming Language,1962,David J.

Ini,"The INI file format is an informal standard for configuration files for some platforms or software. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure composed of sections, properties, and values. In MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows platforms up through Windows ME, the INI file served as the primary mechanism to configure operating system and installed applications features, such as device drivers, fonts, startup launchers, and things that needed to be initialized in booting Windows. INI files were also generally used by applications to store their individual settings. Starting with Windows NT, Microsoft favored the use of the registry, and began to steer developers away from using INI files for configuration. All subsequent versions of Windows have used the Windows Registry for system configuration, and applications built on the .NET Framework use special XML .config files. The APIs still exist in Windows, however, and developers may still use them. The name ""INI file"" comes from the commonly used filename extension .INI, which stands for ""initialization"". Other common initialization file extensions are .CFG, .conf, and .TXT, especially CONFIG.SYS and 'config.txt' occurrences. Linux and Unix systems also use a similar file format for system configuration. In addition, platform-agnostic software may use this file format for configuration. It is human-readable and simple to parse, so it is a usable format for configuration files that do not require much greater complexity. For example, the platform-agnostic PHP uses the INI format for its ""php.ini"" configuration file in both Windows and Linux systems.

AXIOM,"An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek axíōma (ἀξίωμα) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident.'The term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study. As defined in classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question. As used in modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.As used in mathematics, the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses: ""logical axioms"" and ""non-logical axioms"". Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (A and B) implies A), often shown in symbolic form, while non-logical axioms (e.g., a + b = b + a) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as arithmetic). When used in the latter sense, ""axiom"", ""postulate"", and ""assumption"" may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory.  To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain. Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived.  Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be ""true"" is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics.",Programming Language,1992,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5aa0cc98cc623c61d77cd900dbacc21d921152a3,256,NA,NA,NA,4990,0,IBM

The newer syntax, ""SCSS"", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively. CSS3 consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply to them. Sass (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, particularly object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself. When SassScript is interpreted, it creates blocks of CSS rules for various selectors as defined by the Sass file. The Sass interpreter translates SassScript into CSS. Alternatively, Sass can monitor the .sass or .scss file and translate it to an output .css file whenever the .sass or .scss file is saved. Sass is simply syntactic sugar for CSS. The official implementation of Sass is open-source and coded in Ruby; however, other implementations exist, including PHP, and a high-performance implementation in C called libSass. There's also a Java implementation called JSass. Additionally, Vaadin has a Java implementation of Sass. The indented syntax is a metalanguage. SCSS is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid SCSS with the same semantics. Sass supports integration with the Firefox extension Firebug. SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector inheritance.",stylesheetLanguage,2006,Hampton Lintorn-Catlin,http://sass-lang.com/,NA,257,sass,NA,NA,3241,0,NA

PL/pgSQL,"PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostgreSQL) is a procedural programming language supported by the PostgreSQL ORDBMS.  It closely resembles Oracle's PL/SQL language. Implemented by Jan Wieck, PL/pgSQL first appeared with PostgreSQL 6.4, released on October 30, 1998. Version 9 also implements some ISO SQL/PSM features, like overloading of SQL-invoked functions and procedures.PL/pgSQL, as a fully featured programming language, allows much more procedural control than SQL, including the ability to use loops and other control structures. SQL statements and triggers can call functions created in the PL/pgSQL language. The design of PL/pgSQL aimed to allow PostgreSQL users to perform more complex operations and computations than SQL, while providing ease of use. The language is able to be defined as trusted by the server.PL/pgSQL is one of the programming languages included in the standard PostgreSQL distribution, the others being PL/Tcl, PL/Perl and PL/Python. In addition many others are available from third parties, including PL/Java, PL/pgPSM, PL/php, PL/R,  PL/Ruby,PL/sh,  PL/Lua and PL/v8.

Whitespace,"Whitespace is an esoteric programming language developed by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris at the University of Durham (also developers of the Kaya and Idris programming languages). It was released on 1 April 2003 (April Fool's Day). Its name is a reference to whitespace characters. Unlike most programming languages, which ignore or assign little meaning to most whitespace characters, the Whitespace interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters. Only spaces, tabs and linefeeds have meaning. An interesting consequence of this property is that a Whitespace program can easily be contained within the whitespace characters of a program written in another language, except possibly in languages which depend on spaces for syntax validity such as Python, making the text a polyglot. The language itself is an imperative stack-based language. The virtual machine on which the programs run has a stack and a heap. The programmer is free to push arbitrary-width integers onto the stack (currently there is no implementation of floating point numbers) and can also access the heap as a permanent store for variables and data structures.",esolang,2003,NA,NA,NA,261,NA,NA,NA,1650,0,NA

Morse code,"Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes  or dits and dahs. Morse code is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph. The International Morse Code encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a character is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dots, and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots. To increase the efficiency of encoding, Morse code was designed so that the length of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence in text of the English language character that it represents. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter ""E"", has the shortest code: a single dot. Because the Morse code elements are specified by proportion rather than specific time durations, the code is usually transmitted at the highest rate that the receiver is capable of decoding. The Morse code transmission rate (speed) is specified in groups per minute, commonly referred to as words per minute.Morse code is usually transmitted by on-off keying of an information carrying medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light or sound waves.  The current or wave is present during time period of the dot or dash and absent during the time between dots and dashes.Morse code can be memorized, and Morse code signalling in a form perceptible to the human senses, such as sound waves or visible light, can be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill.Because many non-English natural languages use other than the 26 Roman letters, Morse alphabets have been developed for those languages.  In an emergency, Morse code can be generated by improvised methods such as turning a light on and off, tapping on an object or sounding a horn or whistle, making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication. The most common distress signal is SOS – three dots, three dashes, and three dots – internationally recognized by treaty.",notation,1837,NA,NA,NA,265,NA,NA,NA,29235,0,NA
CSP,"In computer science, communicating sequential processes (CSP) is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems. It is a member of the family of mathematical theories of concurrency known as process algebras, or process calculi, based on message passing via channels. CSP was highly influential in the design of the occam programming language, and also influenced the design of programming languages such as Limbo, RaftLib, Go, Crystal, and Clojure's core.async. CSP was first described in a 1978 paper by Tony Hoare, but has since evolved substantially. CSP has been practically applied in industry as a tool for specifying and verifying the concurrent aspects of a variety of different systems, such as the T9000 Transputer, as well as a secure ecommerce system. The theory of CSP itself is also still the subject of active research, including work to increase its range of practical applicability (e.g., increasing the scale of the systems that can be tractably analyzed).",Programming Language,1978,NA,NA,NA,266,NA,NA,NA,1425,0,Oxford University
Self,"Self is an object-oriented programming language based on the concept of prototypes. Self began as a dialect of Smalltalk, being dynamically typed and using just-in-time compilation (JIT) as well as the prototype-based approach to objects: it was first used as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006, Self was still being developed as part of the Klein project, which was a Self virtual machine written fully in Self. The latest version is 2017.1 released in May 2017. Several just-in-time compilation techniques were pioneered and improved in Self research as they were required to allow a very high level object oriented language to perform at up to half the speed of optimized C. Much of the development of Self took place at Sun Microsystems, and the techniques they developed were later deployed for Java's HotSpot virtual machine. At one point a version of Smalltalk was implemented in Self.

Isabelle is generic: it provides a meta-logic (a weak type theory), which is used to encode object logics like first-order logic (FOL), higher-order logic (HOL) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). Isabelle's main proof method is a higher-order version of resolution, based on higher-order unification. Though interactive, Isabelle also features efficient automatic reasoning tools, such as a term rewriting engine and a tableaux prover, as well as various decision procedures.  Isabelle has been used to formalize numerous theorems from mathematics and computer science, like Gödel's completeness theorem, Gödel's theorem about the consistency of the axiom of choice, the prime number theorem, correctness of security protocols, and properties of programming language semantics. The Isabelle theorem prover is free software, released under the revised BSD license.

Batchfile,"A batch file is a kind of script file in DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. A batch file may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional branching and looping within the batch file, such as IF, FOR, and GOTO labels. The term ""batch"" is from batch processing, meaning ""non-interactive execution"", though a batch file may not process a batch of multiple data. Similar to Job Control Language (JCL) and other systems on mainframe and minicomputer systems, batch files were added to ease the work required for certain regular tasks by allowing the user to set up a script to automate them. When a batch file is run, the shell program (usually COMMAND.COM or cmd.exe) reads the file and executes its commands, normally line-by-line. Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, have a similar, but more flexible, type of file called a shell script. The filename extension .bat is used in DOS and Windows. Windows NT and OS/2 also added .cmd. Batch files for other environments may have different extensions, e.g., .btm in 4DOS, 4OS2 and 4NT related shells.

TLA,"TLA+ (pronounced as tee ell a plus, ) is a formal specification language developed by Leslie Lamport. It is used to design, model, document, and verify concurrent systems. TLA+ has been described as exhaustively-testable pseudocode, and its use likened to drawing blueprints for software systems; TLA is an acronym for Temporal Logic of Actions. For design and documentation, TLA+ fulfills the same purpose as informal technical specifications. However, TLA+ specifications are written in a formal language of logic and mathematics, and the precision of specifications written in this language is intended to uncover design flaws before system implementation is underway.Since TLA+ specifications are written in a formal language, they are amenable to finite model checking. The model checker finds all possible system behaviours up to some number of execution steps, and examines them for violations of desired invariance properties such as safety and liveness. TLA+ specifications use basic set theory to define safety (bad things won't happen) and temporal logic to define liveness (good things eventually happen). TLA+ is also used to write machine-checked proofs of correctness both for algorithms and mathematical theorems. The proofs are written in a declarative, hierarchical style independent of any single theorem prover backend. Both formal and informal structured mathematical proofs can be written in TLA+; the language is similar to LaTeX, and tools exist to translate TLA+ specifications to LaTeX documents.TLA+ was introduced in 1999, following several decades of research into a verification method for concurrent systems. A toolchain has since developed, including an IDE and distributed model checker. The pseudocode-like language PlusCal was created in 2009; it transpiles to TLA+ and is useful for specifying sequential algorithms. TLA+2 was announced in 2014, expanding language support for proof constructs.

DNS,"The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985. The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database. The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite. The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database. The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list (RBL).  The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but other database systems are common.",protocol,1985,Paul Mockapetris,NA,NA,283,NA,NA,NA,15790,0,Stanford Research Institute

Ninja,"Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible. In essence, Ninja is meant to replace Make, which is slow when performing incremental (or no-op) builds. This can considerably slow down developers working on large projects, such as Google Chrome which compiles 30,000 input files into a single executable. In fact, Google Chrome is a main user and motivation for Ninja.

Base64,"In computer science, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding. Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. Three 8-bit bytes (i.e., a total of 24 bits) can therefore be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits. Common to all binary-to-text encoding schemes, Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary formats across channels that only reliably support text content. Base64 is particularly prevalent on the World Wide Web where its uses include the ability to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.",textEncodingFormat,1987,NA,NA,NA,292,NA,NA,NA,12030,0,RSA Laboratories

Markup should be rigorous so that the techniques available for processing rigorously-defined objects like programs and databases can be used for processing documents as well.

This is made possible by using Embedded Ruby to generate templates which can contain dynamic content. Embedded Ruby allows ruby code to be embedded in a view document. This code gets replaced with proper value resulted from the execution of the code at run time.

x86-64,"x86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64, AMD64 and Intel 64) is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set. It introduces two new modes of operation, 64-bit mode and compatibility mode, along with a new 4-level paging mode. With 64-bit mode and the new paging mode, it supports vastly larger amounts of virtual memory and physical memory than is possible on its 32-bit predecessors, allowing programs to store larger amounts of data in memory. x86-64 also expands general-purpose registers to 64-bit, as well extends the number of them from 8 (some of which had limited or fixed functionality, e.g. for stack management) to 16 (fully general), and provides numerous other enhancements. Floating point operations are supported via mandatory SSE2-like instructions, and x87/MMX style registers are generally not used (but still available even in 64-bit mode); instead, a set of 32 vector registers, 128 bits each, is used. (Each can store one or two double-precision numbers or one to four single precision numbers, or various integer formats.) In 64-bit mode, instructions are modified to support 64-bit operands and 64-bit addressing mode. The compatibility mode allows 16- and 32-bit user applications to run unmodified coexisting with 64-bit applications if the 64-bit operating system supports them. As the full x86 16-bit and 32-bit instruction sets remain implemented in hardware without any intervening emulation, these older executables can run with little or no performance penalty, while newer or modified applications can take advantage of new features of the processor design to achieve performance improvements. Also, a processor supporting x86-64 still powers on in real mode for full backward compatibility. The original specification, created by AMD and released in 2000, has been implemented by AMD, Intel and VIA. The AMD K8 processor was the first to implement it. This was the first significant addition to the x86 architecture designed by a company other than Intel. Intel was forced to follow suit and introduced a modified NetBurst family which was software-compatible with AMD's specification. VIA Technologies introduced x86-64 in their VIA Isaiah architecture, with the VIA Nano. The x86-64 architecture is distinct from the Intel Itanium architecture (formerly IA-64), which is not compatible on the native instruction set level with the x86 architecture.

A fourth version of the SPARK language, SPARK 2014, based on Ada 2012, was released on April 30, 2014. SPARK 2014 is a complete re-design of the language and supporting verification tools. The SPARK language consists of a well-defined subset of the Ada language that uses contracts to describe the specification of components in a form that is suitable for both static and dynamic verification. In SPARK83/95/2005, the contracts are encoded in Ada comments (and so are ignored by any standard Ada compiler), but are processed by the SPARK ""Examiner"" and its associated tools. SPARK 2014, in contrast, uses Ada 2012's built-in ""aspect"" syntax to express contracts, bringing them into the core of the language. The main tool for SPARK 2014 (GNATprove) is based on the GNAT/GCC infrastructure, and re-uses almost the entirety of the GNAT Ada 2012 front-end.",Programming Language,1988,NA,NA,NA,336,NA,NA,NA,1990,0,NA

ASN.1,"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is an interface description language for defining data structures that can be serialized and deserialized in a standard, cross-platform way. It's broadly used in telecommunications and computer networking, and especially in cryptography. Protocol developers define data structures in ASN.1 modules, which are generally a section of a broader standards document written in the ASN.1 language. Because the language is both human-readable and machine-readable, modules can be automatically turned into libraries that process their data structures, using an ASN.1 compiler. ASN.1 is similar in purpose and use to protocol buffers and Apache Thrift, which are also interface description languages for cross-platform data serialization. Like those languages, it has a schema (in ASN.1, called a ""module""), and a set of encodings, typically type-length-value encodings. However, ASN.1, defined in 1984, predates them by many years.

NATO phonetic alphabet,"The NATO phonetic alphabet, officially denoted as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, and also commonly known as the ICAO phonetic alphabet, and in a variation also known officially as the ITU phonetic alphabet and figure code, is the most widely used radiotelephone spelling alphabet. Although often called ""phonetic alphabets"", spelling alphabets are unrelated to phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers are most likely to be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone, regardless of language differences or the quality of the communication channel.The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot,  Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu.Strict adherence to the prescribed spelling words is required in order to avoid the problems of confusion that the spelling alphabet is designed to overcome. As noted in a 1955 NATO memo,  It is known that [the ICAO spelling alphabet] has been prepared only after the most exhaustive tests on a scientific basis by several nations. One of the firmest conclusions reached was that it was not practical to make an isolated change to clear confusion between one pair of letters. To change one word involves reconsideration of the whole alphabet to ensure that the change proposed to clear one confusion does not itself introduce others. The same memo notes a potential confusion between ZERO and SIERRA is overcome when following the procedures in ACP 125, which specify the use of the procedure word FIGURES in many instances in which digits need to be read.",notation,1956,NA,NA,NA,346,NA,NA,NA,66990,0,International Civil Aviation Organization
HyperTalk,"HyperTalk is a high-level, procedural programming language created in 1987 by Dan Winkler and used in conjunction with Apple Computer's HyperCard hypermedia program by Bill Atkinson. The main target audience of HyperTalk was beginning programmers, hence HyperTalk programmers were usually called authors, and the process of writing programs was called ""scripting"". HyperTalk scripts are fairly similar to written English, and use a logic structure similar to that of the Pascal programming language. It supports the basic control structures of procedural languages: repeat for/while/until, if/then/else, as well as function and message ""handler"" calls (a handler is a subroutine, a message handler is a procedure). Data types are transparent to the user, conversion happens transparently in the background between strings and numbers. There are no classes or data structures in the traditional sense; their place was taken by special string literals, or rather ""lists"" of ""items"" delimited by commas (in later versions the ""itemDelimiter"" property allowed choosing an arbitrary character). In the late 1980s Apple considered using HyperCard's HyperTalk scripting language as the standard language across the company and within its classic Mac OS operating system, and for interprocess communication between Apple and non-Apple products. The company did not oppose the development of imitations like SuperCard, and created a HyperTalk Standards Committee to avoid incompatibility between language variants.

EML,"Mbox is a generic term for a family of related file formats used for holding collections of email messages, first implemented for Fifth Edition Unix. All messages in an mbox mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain text in a single file. Each message starts with the four characters ""From"" followed by a space (the so named ""From_ line"") and the sender's email address. RFC 4155 defines that a UTC timestamp follows after another separating space character. Unlike the Internet protocols used for the exchange of email, the format used for the storage of email has never been formally defined through the RFC standardization mechanism and has been entirely left to the developer of an email client. However, the POSIX standard defined a loose frame in conjunction with the mailx program. In 2005 finally, the application/mbox media type was standardized as RFC 4155, and hints that mbox stores mailbox messages in their original Internet Message (RFC 2822) format, except for the used newline character, seven-bit clean data storage, and the requirement that each newly added message is terminated with a completely empty line within the mbox database. A format similar to mbox is the MH Message Handling System.

Oberon-2,"Oberon-2 is an extension of the original Oberon programming language that adds limited reflection and object-oriented programming facilities, open arrays as pointer base types, read-only field export and reintroduces the FOR loop from Modula-2. It was developed in 1991 at ETH Zurich by Niklaus Wirth and Hanspeter Mössenböck, who is now at Institut für Systemsoftware (SSW) of the University of Linz, Austria.  Oberon-2 is a superset of Oberon, and is fully compatible with it.  Oberon-2 was a redesign of Object Oberon. Oberon-2 inherited limited reflection and single inheritance (""type extension"") without interfaces or mixins from Oberon, but added efficient virtual methods (""type bound procedures""). Method calls were resolved at run-time using C++-style virtual method tables. Compared to fully object-oriented programming languages like Smalltalk, in Oberon-2 basic types are not objects, classes are not objects, many operations are not methods, there is no message passing (to a certain extent it can be emulated by reflection and through message extension, as demonstrated in ETH Oberon), and polymorphism is limited to subclasses of a common class (no duck typing like in  Python, and it's not possible to define interfaces like in Java). Oberon-2 does not support encapsulation at object/class level, but modules can be used for this purpose. Reflection in Oberon-2 does not use meta-objects, but simply reads from type descriptors compiled into the executable binaries, and exposed in the modules that define the types and/or procedures.  If the format of these structures are exposed at the language level (as is the case for ETH Oberon, for example), reflection could be implemented at the library level.  It could therefore be implemented almost entirely at library level, without changing the language code.  Indeed, ETH Oberon makes use of language-level and library-level reflection capabilities extensively. Oberon-2 provides built-in run-time support for garbage collection similar to Java and performs bounds and array index checks, etc. that eliminate the potential stack and array bounds overwriting problems and manual memory management issues inherent in C/C++.  Separate compilation using symbol files and name-spaces via the module architecture ensure quick rebuilds since only modules with changed interfaces need to be recompiled.

LINQ,"Language Integrated Query (LINQ, pronounced ""link"") is a Microsoft .NET Framework component that adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages, although ports exist for PHP (PHPLinq), JavaScript (linq.js), TypeScript (linq.ts), and ActionScript (ActionLinq) - but none of these ports are strictly equivalent to LINQ in C# for example (where it is a part of the language, not an external library, and where it often addresses a wider range of needs). LINQ extends the language by the addition of query expressions, which are akin to SQL statements, and can be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays, enumerable classes, XML documents, relational databases, and third-party data sources. Other uses, which utilize query expressions as a general framework for readably composing arbitrary computations, include the construction of event handlers or monadic parsers. LINQ also defines a set of method names (called standard query operators, or standard sequence operators), along with translation rules used by the compiler to translate fluent-style query expressions into expressions using these method names, lambda expressions and anonymous types. Many of the concepts that LINQ has introduced were originally tested in Microsoft's Cω research project.

Originally developed for Solaris, it has since been released under the free Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) and has been ported to several other Unix-like systems. DTrace can be used to get a global overview of a running system, such as the amount of memory, CPU time, filesystem and network resources used by the active processes. It can also provide much more fine-grained information, such as a log of the arguments with which a specific function is being called, or a list of the processes accessing a specific file. In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems. In October 2011, Oracle announced the porting of DTrace to Linux, but for several years only an unofficial DTrace port to Linux was available, with no changes in licensing terms.In August 2017, Oracle released DTrace kernel code under the GPLv2+ license, and user space code under GPLv2 and UPL licensing.

LiveCode,"LiveCode (formerly Revolution and MetaCard) is a cross-platform rapid application development runtime environment inspired by HyperCard. It features the Transcript (formerly MetaTalk) programming language which belongs to the family of xTalk scripting languages like HyperCard's HyperTalk. The environment was introduced in 2001. The ""Revolution"" development system was based on the MetaCard engine technology which Runtime Revolution later acquired from MetaCard Corporation in 2003. The platform won the Macworld Annual Editor's Choice Award for ""Best Development Software"" in 2004. ""Revolution"" was renamed ""LiveCode"" in the fall of 2010. ""LiveCode"" is developed and sold by Runtime Revolution Ltd., based in Edinburgh, Scotland. In March, 2015, the company was renamed ""LiveCode Ltd."", to unify the company name with the product. In April 2013 a free/open source version 'LiveCode Community Edition 6.0' was published after a successful crowdfunding campaign at Kickstarter. The code base was re-licensed and made available as free and open source software with a version in April 2013. LiveCode runs on iOS, Android, OS X, Windows 95 through Windows 10, Raspberry Pi and several variations of Unix, including Linux, Solaris, and BSD. It can be used for mobile, desktop and server/CGI applications. The iOS (iPhone and iPad) version was released in December 2010. The first version to deploy to the Web was released in 2009. It is the most widely used HyperCard/HyperTalk clone, and the only one that runs on all major operating systems. A developer release of v.8 was announced in New York on March 12, 2015. This major enhancement to the product includes a new, separate development language, known as ""LiveCode Builder"", which is capable of creating new object classes called ""widgets"". In earlier versions, the set of object classes was fixed, and could only be enhanced via the use of ordinary procedural languages like C. The new language, which runs in its own IDE, is a departure from the transitional x-talk paradigm in that it permits typing of variables. But the two environments are fully integrated, and apart from the ability to create new objects, development in LiveCode proceeds in the normal way, within the established IDE. A second crowdfunding campaign to Bring HTML5 to LiveCode reached funding goals of nearly $400,000 USD on July 31, 2014.

PEG,"In computer science, a parsing expression grammar, or PEG, is a type of analytic formal grammar, i.e. it describes a formal language in terms of a set of rules for recognizing strings in the language. The formalism was introduced by Bryan Ford in 2004 and is closely related to the family of top-down parsing languages introduced in the early 1970s. Syntactically, PEGs also look similar to context-free grammars (CFGs), but they have a different interpretation: the choice operator selects the first match in PEG, while it is ambiguous in CFG. This is closer to how string recognition tends to be done in practice, e.g. by a recursive descent parser. Unlike CFGs, PEGs cannot be ambiguous; if a string parses, it has exactly one valid parse tree. It is conjectured that there exist context-free languages that cannot be recognized by a PEG, but this is not yet proven. PEGs are well-suited to parsing computer languages (and artificial human languages such as Lojban), but not natural languages where the performance of PEG algorithms is comparable to general CFG algorithms such as the Earley algorithm.",grammarLanguage,2002,NA,NA,NA,406,NA,Yes,NA,955,0,NA

The diff command displays the changes made in a standard format, such that both humans and machines can understand the changes and apply them: given one file and the changes, the other file can be created. Typically, diff is used to show the changes between two versions of the same file. Modern implementations also support binary files. The output is called a ""diff"", or a patch, since the output can be applied with the Unix program patch.

TXL,"TXL is a special-purpose programming language originally designed by Charles Halpern-Hamu and James Cordy at the University of Toronto in 1985.  The acronym ""TXL"" originally stood for ""Turing eXtender Language"" after the language's original purpose, the specification and rapid prototyping of variants and extensions of the Turing programming language, but no longer has any meaningful interpretation. Modern TXL is specifically designed for creating, manipulating and rapidly prototyping language-based descriptions, tools and applications using source transformation.   It is a hybrid functional / rule-based language using first order functional programming at the higher level and term rewriting at the lower level.  The formal semantics and implementation of TXL are based on formal term rewriting, but the term structures are largely hidden from the user due to the example-like style of pattern specification. Each TXL program has two components: a description of the source structures to be transformed, specified as a (possibly ambiguous) context-free grammar using an extended Backus–Naur Form; and a set of tree transformation rules, specified using pattern / replacement pairs combined using first order functional programming.  TXL is designed to allow explicit programmer control over the interpretation, application, order and backtracking of both parsing and rewriting rules, allowing for expression of a wide range of grammar-based techniques such as agile parsing. The first component parses the input expression into a tree using pattern-matching. The second component uses Term-rewriting in a manner similar to Yacc to produce the transformed output. TXL is most commonly used in software analysis and reengineering tasks such as design recovery, and in rapid prototyping of new programming languages and dialects.",Programming Language,1985,James Cordy,NA,NA,432,txl,NA,NA,265,0,NA

Sather,"Sather is an object-oriented programming language. It originated circa 1990 at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley, developed by an international team led by Steve Omohundro. It supports garbage collection and generics by subtypes. Originally, it was based on Eiffel, but it has diverged, and now includes several functional programming features. It is probably best to view it as an object-oriented language, with many ideas borrowed from Eiffel. Even the name is inspired by Eiffel; the Sather Tower is a recognizable landmark at Berkeley, named after Jane Krom Sather, the widow of Peder Sather, who donated large sums to the foundation of the university. Sather also takes inspiration from other programming languages and paradigms: iterators, design by contract, abstract classes, multiple inheritance, anonymous functions, operator overloading, contravariant type system. The original Berkeley implementation (last stable version 1.1 was released in 1995, no longer maintained) has been adopted by the Free Software Foundation therefore becoming GNU Sather. Last stable GNU version (1.2.3) was released in July 2007 and the software is currently not maintained. There were several other variants: Sather-K from the University of Karlsruhe; Sather-W from the University of Waikato (implementation of Sather version 1.3); Peter Naulls' port of ICSI Sather 1.1 to RISC OS; and pSather, a parallel version of ICSI Sather addressing non-uniform memory access multiprocessor architectures but presenting a shared memory model to the programmer. The former ICSI Sather compiler (now GNU Sather) is implemented as a compiler to C, i.e., the compiler does not output object or machine code, but takes Sather source code and generates C source code as an intermediate language. Optimizing is left to the C compiler. The GNU Sather compiler, written in Sather itself, is dual licensed under the GNU GPL & LGPL.",Programming Language,1990,Steve Omohundro,https://www.gnu.org/software/sather/,NA,435,NA,Yes,--,126,0,NA

RISC-V,"RISC-V (pronounced ""risk-five"") is an open instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. In contrast to most ISAs, the RISC-V ISA can be freely used for any purpose, permitting anyone to design, manufacture and sell RISC-V chips and software. While not the first open ISA, it is significant because it is designed to be useful in modern computerized devices such as warehouse-scale cloud computers, high-end mobile phones and the smallest embedded systems. Such uses demand that the designers consider both performance and power efficiency. The instruction set also has a substantial body of supporting software, which fixes a usual weakness of new instruction sets. The project began in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley, but many contributors are volunteers and industry workers outside the university. The RISC-V ISA has been designed with small, fast, and low-power real-world implementations in mind, but without over-architecting for a particular microarchitecture style. As of May 2017, version 2.2 of the userspace ISA is fixed and the privileged ISA is available as draft version 1.10.",isa,2010,NA,NA,NA,437,NA,NA,NA,2140,0,"University of California, Berkeley"

Tiny BASIC,"Tiny BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language that can fit into as little as 2 or 3 KB of memory. This small size made it invaluable in the early days of microcomputers in the mid-1970s, when typical memory size was only 4 to 8 KB. To meet these strict size limits, math was purely integer based and it lacked arrays. The language was written, in part, as an alternative to Microsoft BASIC. MS BASIC would also run in 4 KB machines, but left only 790 bytes free for the programs. More free space was a significant advantage of Tiny BASIC. Piracy of MS BASIC led Bill Gates to publish an open letter complaining about people ""stealing"" BASIC, which further helped drive the popularity of this alternative. Tiny BASIC was published in a newsletter offshoot of the People's Computer Company. Dozens of versions were created for almost every platform of the era, and there were many variations and additions that were published over time.

HLSL,"The High-Level Shader Language or High-Level Shading Language (HLSL) is a proprietary shading language developed by Microsoft for the Direct3D 9 API to augment the shader assembly language, and went on to become the required shading language for the unified shader model of Direct3D 10 and higher. HLSL is analogous to the GLSL shading language used with the OpenGL standard. It is very similar to the Nvidia Cg shading language, as it was developed alongside it.  HLSL shaders can enable profound speed and detail increases as well as many special effects in both 2d and 3d computer graphics.HLSL programs come in five forms: pixel shaders (fragment in GLSL), vertex shaders, geometry shaders, compute shaders and tessellation shaders (Hull and Domain shaders). A vertex shader is executed for each vertex that is submitted by the application, and is primarily responsible for transforming the vertex from object space to view space, generating texture coordinates, and calculating lighting coefficients such as the vertex's tangent, binormal and normal vectors. When a group of vertices (normally 3, to form a triangle) come through the vertex shader, their output position is interpolated to form pixels within its area; this process is known as rasterisation. Each of these pixels comes through the pixel shader, whereby the resultant screen colour is calculated. Optionally, an application using a Direct3D 10/11/12 interface and Direct3D 10/11/12 hardware may also specify a geometry shader. This shader takes as its input some vertices of a primitive (triangle/line/point) and uses this data to generate/degenerate (or tessellate) additional primitives or to change the type of primitives, which are each then sent to the rasterizer.

PIC microcontroller,"PIC (usually pronounced as ""pick"") is a family of microcontrollers made by Microchip Technology, derived from the PIC1650  originally developed by General Instrument's Microelectronics Division. The name PIC initially referred to Peripheral Interface Controller, then it was corrected as Programmable Intelligent Computer. The first parts of the family were available in 1976; by 2013 the company had shipped more than twelve billion individual parts, used in a wide variety of embedded systems. Early models of PIC had read-only memory (ROM) or field-programmable EPROM for program storage, some with provision for erasing memory. All current models use flash memory for program storage, and newer models allow the PIC to reprogram itself. Program memory and data memory are separated. Data memory is 8-bit, 16-bit, and, in latest models, 32-bit wide. Program instructions vary in bit-count by family of PIC, and may be 12, 14, 16, or 24 bits long. The instruction set also varies by model, with more powerful chips adding instructions for digital signal processing functions. The hardware capabilities of PIC devices range from 6-pin SMD, 8-pin DIP chips up to 144-pin SMD chips, with discrete I/O pins, ADC and DAC modules, and communications ports such as UART, I2C, CAN, and even USB. Low-power and high-speed variations exist for many types. The manufacturer supplies computer software for development known as MPLAB X, assemblers and C/C++ compilers, and programmer/debugger hardware under the MPLAB and PICKit series. Third party and some open-source tools are also available. Some parts have in-circuit programming capability; low-cost development programmers are available as well as high-production programmers. PIC devices are popular with both industrial developers and hobbyists due to their low cost, wide availability, large user base, extensive collection of application notes, availability of low cost or free development tools, serial programming, and re-programmable Flash-memory capability.",Programming Language,1975,NA,NA,NA,469,NA,NA,NA,710,0,"Microchip Technology, Inc"

muPad,"MuPAD is a computer algebra system (CAS). Originally developed by the MuPAD research group at the University of Paderborn, Germany, development was taken over by the company SciFace Software GmbH & Co.

Until autumn 2005, the version ""MuPAD Light"" was offered for free for research and education, but as a result of the closure of the home institute of the MuPAD research group, only the version ""MuPAD Pro"" became available for purchase. The MuPAD kernel is bundled with Scientific Notebook and Scientific Workplace. Former versions of MuPAD Pro were bundled with SciLab. In MathCAD's version 14 release Mupad was adopted as the CAS engine. In September 2008, SciFace was purchased by MathWorks and the MuPAD code was included in the Symbolic Math Toolbox add-on for MATLAB. On 28 September 2008, MuPAD was withdrawn from the market as a software product in its own right.

DRAKON,"DRAKON is an algorithmic visual programming language developed within the Buran space project following ergonomic design principles. The language provides a uniform way to represent flowcharts of any complexity that are easy to read and understand. The DRAKON Editor, which was released in September 2011, is an implementation of the language available in the public domain. It can be used for creating documentation, or for creating visual programs that can be converted to source code in other languages. Unlike UML's philosophy, DRAKON language philosophy is based on being augmented if needed, by using a hybrid language, which can be illustrated as ""incrustating code snippets from text language used into shape DRAKON requires"". This way, DRAKON stays an all-way simple visual language per se, that can be used as an augmentation for a programmer, who is interested in making own project code easier for support or other long-term needs, i.e. improving ergonomics of coding process or to make code easy to review and understand. Name DRAKON is Russian acronym for ""Дружелюбный Русский Алгоритмический [язык], Который Обеспечивает Наглядность"", which translates""Friendly Russian algorithmic [language] that provides illustrativeness (or clarity)"".  The word ""наглядность"" (pronounced approximately as ""naa-glya-dno-st-th"") refers to a quality of concept or idea being easy to imagine and understand, and may be translated as ""clarity"" as well.  It is to note, that DRAKON language can be used both as modelling\""markup"" language (which is considered a standalone ""pure DRAKON"" program making) and as programming language (as part of a hybrid language). Integration of stricter, ""academic"" variant of a markup language into programming, which any DRAKON-(programming language used) provides, supposedly (as intended by initial philosophy of DRAKON development) adds syntactic sugar to such extent users of different text programming language can comprehend each other's input into the overall project and criticize it upon necessity.",Programming Language,1996,Stepan Mitkin,https://drakon-editor.com/,NA,477,NA,NA,NA,1112,0,Soviet space program
Unicon,"Unicon is a programming language designed by American computer scientist Clint Jeffery with collaborators including Shamim Mohamed, Jafar Al Gharaibeh, Robert Parlett and others. Unicon descended from Icon and a preprocessor for Icon called IDOL. Compared with Icon, Unicon offers better access to the operating system as well as support for object-oriented programming. Unicon began life as a merger of three popular Icon extensions: an OO preprocessor named Idol, a POSIX filesystem and networking interface, and an ODBC facility. The name is shorthand for ""Unified Extended Dialect of Icon."" Compared with Icon, many of the new features of Unicon are extensions to the I/O and system interface, to complement Icon's core control and data structures. Rather than providing lower-level APIs as-is from C, Unicon implements higher level and easier to use facilities, enabling rapid development of graphic- and network-intensive applications in addition to Icon's core strengths in text and file processing. classes and packages exceptions as a contributed class library - see mailing list loadable child programs monitoring of child programs dynamic loading of C modules (some platforms) multiple inheritance, with novel semantics ODBC database access dbm files can be used as associative arrays posix system interface 3D graphics true concurrency (on platforms supporting Posix threads) When run as a graphical IDE, the Unicon program ui.exe continues to offer links to Icon help.

Hope was derived from NPL, a simple functional language developed by Rod Burstall and John Darlington in their work on program transformation. NPL was, in turn, derived from Kleene Recursion Equations. NPL and Hope are notable for being the first languages with call-by-pattern evaluation and algebraic data types. (Though SNOBOL is even older, and its 'patterns' may qualify as a hybrid between call-by-pattern and regular expression matching.) Hope is an important language in the development of functional programming.

PL/M,"The PL/M programming language  (an acronym of Programming Language for Microcomputers) is a high-level language conceived and developed by  Gary Kildall in 1973  for Hank Smith at Intel for its microprocessors. The language incorporated ideas from PL/I, ALGOL and XPL, and had an integrated macro processor. Unlike other contemporary languages such as Pascal, C or BASIC, PL/M had no standard input or output routines.  It included features targeted at the low-level hardware specific to the target microprocessors, and as such, it could support direct access to any location in memory, I/O ports and the processor interrupt flags in a very efficient manner. PL/M was the first higher level programming language for microprocessor-based computers and was the original implementation language for the CP/M operating system. Many Intel and Zilog Z80 based embedded systems were programmed in PL/M during the 1970s and 1980s. For instance, the firmware of the Service Processor component of CISC AS/400 was written in PL/M. The original PL/M compiler targeted the Intel 8008. An updated version generated code for the 8080 processor, which would also run on the newer Intel 8085 as well as on the Zilog Z80 family (as it is backward-compatible with the 8080). Later followed compilers for the Intel 8048 and Intel 8051-microcontroller family as well as for the 8086 (8088), 80186 (80188) and subsequent 8086-based processors, including the advanced 80286 and the 32-bit 80386. There were also PL/M compilers developed for later microcontrollers, such as the Intel 8061 and 8096 / MCS-96 architecture family.  While some PL/M compilers were ""native"", meaning that they ran on systems using that same microprocessor, e.g. for the Intel ISIS operating system, there were also ""cross compilers"", for instance PLMX, which ran on other operating environments such as CP/M, Microsoft's DOS, and Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX/VMS.

A shortcoming of current formats for describing phylogenetic trees (such as Nexus and Newick/New Hampshire) is a lack of a standardized means to annotate tree nodes and branches with distinct data fields (which in the case of a basic species tree might be: species names, branch lengths, and possibly multiple support values). Data storage and exchange is even more cumbersome in studies in which trees are the result of a reconciliation of some kind:  gene-function studies (requires annotation of nodes with taxonomic information as well as gene names, and possibly gene-duplication data) evolution of host-parasite interactions (requires annotation of tree nodes with taxonomic information for both host and parasite) phylogeographic studies (requires annotation of tree nodes with taxonomic and geographic information)To alleviate this, a variety of ad-hoc, special purpose formats have come into use (such as the NHX format, which focuses on the needs of gene-function and phylogenomic studies). A well defined XML format addresses these problems in a general and extensible manner and allows for interoperability between specialized and general purpose software. An example of a program for visualizing phyloXML is Archaeopteryx.",xmlFormat,2009,NA,http://www.phyloxml.org/,NA,521,NA,NA,NA,51,0,World Wide Web Consortium

Advanced Message Queuing Protocol,"The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing (including point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe), reliability and security. AMQP mandates the behavior of the messaging provider and client to the extent that implementations from different vendors are interoperable, in the same way as SMTP, HTTP, FTP, etc. have created interoperable systems. Previous standardizations of middleware have happened at the API level (e.g. JMS) and were focused on standardizing programmer interaction with different middleware implementations, rather than on providing interoperability between multiple implementations. Unlike JMS, which defines an API and a set of behaviors that a messaging implementation must provide, AMQP is a wire-level protocol. A wire-level protocol is a description of the format of the data that is sent across the network as a stream of bytes. Consequently, any tool that can create and interpret messages that conform to this data format can interoperate with any other compliant tool irrespective of implementation language.",protocol,2003,NA,NA,NA,549,NA,NA,NA,2250,0,JPMorgan Chase

As development continued, the name was changed to DDML, reflecting a shift away from the goal of replicating all DTD functionality, in order to concentrate on providing a robust framework for describing basic element/attribute hierarchy. DDML offered no datatypes or functionality beyond what DTDs already provided, so there was not much advantage to using DDML instead of DTDs.

The TSV format is thus a type of the more general delimiter-separated values format. TSV is a simple file format that is widely supported, so it is often used in data exchange to move tabular data between different computer programs that support the format. For example, a TSV file might be used to transfer information from a database program to a spreadsheet. TSV is an alternative to the common comma-separated values (CSV) format, which often causes difficulties because of the need to escape commas – literal commas are very common in text data, but literal tab stops are infrequent in running text.

PCRE,"Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression capabilities in the Perl programming language. Philip Hazel started writing PCRE in summer 1997. PCRE's syntax is much more powerful and flexible than either of the POSIX regular expression flavors and than that of many other regular-expression libraries. While PCRE originally aimed at feature-equivalence with Perl, the two implementations are not fully equivalent. During the PCRE 7.x and Perl 5.9.x phase, the two projects have coordinated development, with features being ported between them in both directions. A number of prominent open-source programs, such as the Apache HTTP Server and the PHP and R scripting languages, incorporate the PCRE library; proprietary software can do likewise (BSD license). As of Perl 5.10, PCRE is also available as a replacement for Perl's default regular expression engine through the re::engine::PCRE module. The library can be built using configure and make (typical of Unix-like environments), as well as in Unix, Windows and other environments using CMake. Numerous default settings are chosen at build time. In addition to the PCRE library, the distribution includes a POSIX C wrapper, a native C++ wrapper, several test programs, and the utility program pcregrep built in tandem with the library. The PCRE library provides matching only; the C++ wrapper, if used, adds multiple match and replacement functionality. Unless users choose the ""NoRecurse"" PCRE build option (aka ""--disable-stack-for-recursion""), the calling application or operating system must allocate adequate stack space to PCRE. The amount of stack needed varies for each pattern. For example, completing the tests provided with pcretest needs 8 MB of stack space. While PCRE's documentation cautions that the ""NoRecurse"" build option makes PCRE slower than the alternative, using it avoids entirely the issue of stack overflows.",queryLanguage,1997,Philip Hazel,http://pcre.org/,NA,581,NA,NA,NA,1000,0,https://github.com/PCRE2Project

Curl,"Curl is a reflective object-oriented programming language for interactive web applications whose goal is to provide a smoother transition between formatting and programming. It makes it possible to embed complex objects in simple documents without needing to switch between programming languages or development platforms. The Curl implementation initially consisted of just an interpreter, but a compiler was added later. Curl combines text markup (as in HTML), scripting (as in JavaScript), and heavy-duty computing (as in Java, C#, or C++) within one unified framework. It is used in a range of internal enterprise, B2B, and B2C applications. Curl programs may be compiled into Curl applets, that are viewed using the Curl RTE, a runtime environment with a plugin for web browsers. Currently, it is supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. Curl supports ""detached applets"", which is a web deployed applet which runs on the user's desktop independent of a browser window much as in Silverlight 3 and Adobe AIR.",Programming Language,1998,Steve Ward,http://www.curl.com,NA,583,NA,NA,NA,571,0,"Curl, Inc && Sumisho Computer Systems Corp && SCSK Corporation"
LotusScript,"LotusScript is an object oriented programming language used by Lotus Notes (since version 4.0) and other IBM Lotus Software products. LotusScript is similar to Visual Basic. Developers familiar with one can easily understand the syntax and structure of code in the other. The major differences between the two are in their respective Integrated Development Environments and in the product-specific object classes provided in each language that are included. VB includes a richer set of classes for UI manipulation, whereas LotusScript includes a richer set of application-specific classes for Lotus Notes, Lotus Word Pro and Lotus 1-2-3. In the case of Lotus Notes, there are classes to work with Notes databases, documents (records) in those databases, etc. These classes can also be used as OLE Automation objects outside of the Lotus Notes environment, from Visual Basic. LotusScript also allows the definition of user-defined types and classes, although it is not possible to inherit from the product-specific classes.",Programming Language,1996,NA,NA,NA,584,NA,Yes,NA,165,0,Lotus Development Corporation

Up-arrow notation,"In mathematics, Knuth's up-arrow notation is a method of notation for very large integers, introduced by Donald Knuth in 1976. In his 1947 paper, R. L. Goodstein introduced the specific sequence of operations that are now called hyperoperations. Goodstein also suggested the Greek names tetration, pentation, etc., for the extended operations beyond exponentiation. The sequence starts with a unary operation (the successor function with n = 0), and continues with the binary operations of addition (n = 1), multiplication (n = 2), exponentiation (n = 3), tetration (n = 4), pentation (n = 5), etc. Various notations have been used to represent hyperoperations. One such notation is                                    H                        n                             (         a         ,         b         )                 {\displaystyle H_{n}(a,b)}   . Another notation is                         a         [         n         ]         b                 {\displaystyle a[n]b}   , an infix notation which is convenient for ASCII. The notation                         a         [         n         ]         b                 {\displaystyle a[n]b}    is known as 'square bracket notation'. Knuth's up-arrow notation                         ↑                 {\displaystyle \uparrow }    is an alternative notation. It is obtained by replacing                         [         n         ]                 {\displaystyle [n]}    in the square bracket notation by n-2 arrows. For example:  the single arrow                         ↑                 {\displaystyle \uparrow }    represents exponentiation (iterated multiplication)                        2         ↑         4

SQL-92,"SQL-92 was the third revision of the SQL database query language. Unlike SQL-89, it was a major revision of the standard.  Aside from a few minor incompatibilities, the SQL-89 standard is forward-compatible with SQL-92. The standard specification itself grew about five times compared to SQL-89. Much of it was due to more precise specifications of existing features; the increase due to new features was only by a factor of 1.5–2. Many of the new features had already been implemented by vendors before the new standard was adopted. However, most of the new features were added to the ""intermediate"" and ""full"" tiers of the specification, meaning that conformance with SQL-92 entry level was scarcely any more demanding than conformance with SQL-89. Later revisions of the standard include SQL:1999 (SQL3), SQL:2003, SQL:2008, SQL:2011 and SQL:2016.",Programming Language,1992,NA,NA,NA,593,NA,NA,NA,545,0,NA

UTC,"Coordinated Universal Time (abbreviated to UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0° longitude, and is not adjusted for daylight saving time. In some countries where English is spoken, the term Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is often used as a synonym for UTC and predates UTC by nearly 300 years.The first Coordinated Universal Time was informally adopted on 1 January 1960 and was first officially adopted as CCIR Recommendation 374, Standard-Frequency and Time-Signal Emissions, in 1963, but the official abbreviation of UTC and the official English name of Coordinated Universal Time (along with the French equivalent) were not adopted until 1967.The system has been adjusted several times, including a brief period where time coordination radio signals broadcast both UTC and ""Stepped Atomic Time (SAT)"" before a new UTC was adopted in 1970 and implemented in 1972. This change also adopted leap seconds to simplify future adjustments. This CCIR Recommendation 460 ""stated that (a) carrier frequencies and time intervals should be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the SI second; (b) step adjustments, when necessary, should be exactly 1 s to maintain approximate agreement with Universal Time (UT); and (c) standard signals should contain information on the difference between UTC and UT.""A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds. A decision whether to remove them altogether has been deferred until 2023.The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications Union Recommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions, and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the slowing of the Earth's rotation. Leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of the UT1 variant of universal time. See the ""Current number of leap seconds"" section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date.",timeFormat,1960,NA,NA,NA,596,NA,NA,NA,19765,0,NA

Modula,"The Modula programming language is a descendant of the Pascal programming language. It was developed in Switzerland in the 1970s by Niklaus Wirth, the same person who designed Pascal. The main innovation of Modula over Pascal is a module system, used for grouping sets of related declarations into program units; hence the name Modula. The language is defined in a report by Wirth called Modula. A language for modular multiprogramming published 1976. Modula was first implemented by Niklaus Wirth himself on a PDP-11. Very soon other implementations followed, most important the University of York Modula compiler and a compiler developed at Philips Laboratories named PL Modula, which generated code for the LSI-11 microprocessor. The development of Modula was discontinued soon after its publication. Wirth then concentrated his efforts on Modula's successor, Modula-2.",Programming Language,1975,Niklaus Wirth,NA,NA,602,NA,NA,NA,205,0,ETH Zurich
Clarion,"Clarion is a commercial, 4GL, multi-paradigm, programming language and Integrated Development Environment from SoftVelocity used to program database applications. It is compatible with ISAM, SQL and ADO data access methods, reads and writes several flat file desktop database formats including ASCII, CSV, DOS (Binary), FoxPro, Clipper, dBase, and some relational databases via ODBC, MS SQL Server, Sybase SQL Anywhere and Oracle through the use of accelerated native database drivers, and XML, Clarion can be used to output to HTML, XML, plaintext, and PDF, among others. The Clarion Development Environment (IDE) sits on top of the Clarion Programming Language. The IDE provides code generation facilities via a system of templates which allow programmers to describe the program from an abstract level higher than actual code statements. The generator then turns this higher level into code, which in turn is then compiled and linked using a normal compiler and linker. This generation layer is sometimes referred to as 4GL programming. The generation layer is not required. It is possible to create programs completely at the code level (the so-called 3GL layer), bypassing all the code generation facilities. If the templates are used to generate code then programmers are able to inject their own code into the generated code to alter, or extend, the functionality offered by the template layer. This process of embedding code can be done while viewing the surrounding generated code. This mixing of template code and generated code allows the template settings to be updated, and the code regenerated, without the loss of the embedded code. The templates (from which the code is generated) are provided in source form and developers are free to create their own templates. A large collection of templates have been written by various developers some of which are offered as commercial add-ons and some of which are free. There are several Clarion products available; Clarion Professional Edition, Clarion Enterprise Edition and Clarion.Net.",Programming Language,1986,NA,http://www.softvelocity.com,NA,603,clw,NA,NA,546,0,Jensen & Partners International && Clarion International && SoftVelocity

CSV,"In computing, a comma-separated values (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. The CSV file format is not standardized. The basic idea of separating fields with a comma is clear, but that idea gets complicated when the field data may also contain commas or even embedded line-breaks. CSV implementations may not handle such field data, or they may use quotation marks to surround the field. Quotation does not solve everything: some fields may need embedded quotation marks, so a CSV implementation may include escape characters or escape sequences. In addition, the term ""CSV"" also denotes some closely related delimiter-separated formats that use different field delimiters. These include tab-separated values and space-separated values. A delimiter that is not present in the field data (such as tab) keeps the format parsing simple. These alternate delimiter-separated files are often even given a .csv extension despite the use of a non-comma field separator. This loose terminology can cause problems in data exchange. Many applications that accept CSV files have options to select the delimiter character and the quotation character.",dataNotation,1972,NA,NA,NA,607,csv,NA,NA,300,0,NA

The interpreter also included powerful statements for controlling the BBC Micro's four-channel sound output and its low-/high-resolution eight-mode graphics display. One of the unique features of BBC BASIC was the presence of an inline assembler allowing users to write 6502, and later: Z80, NS32016 and ARM assembly language programs. The assembler was fully integrated into the BASIC interpreter and shared variables with it, which could be included between the [ and ] characters, saved via *SAVE and *LOAD, and called via the CALL or USR commands.

Network Time Protocol,"The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware. NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.The protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.The current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4), which is a proposed standard as documented in RFC 5905. It is backward compatible with version 3, specified in RFC 1305.",protocol,1981,NA,NA,NA,650,NA,NA,NA,7225,0,University of Delaware

Telnet,"Telnet is a protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 855, and standardized as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Standard STD 8, one of the first Internet standards. The name stands for ""teletype network"".Historically, Telnet provided access to a command-line interface (usually, of an operating system) on a remote host, including most network equipment and operating systems with a configuration utility (including systems based on Windows NT). However, because of serious security concerns when using Telnet over an open network such as the Internet, its use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of SSH. The term telnet is also used to refer to the software that implements the client part of the protocol. Telnet client applications are available for virtually all computer platforms. Telnet is also used as a verb. To telnet means to establish a connection using the Telnet protocol, either with command line client or with a programmatic interface. For example, a common directive might be: ""To change your password, telnet into the server, log in and run the passwd command."" Most often, a user will be telnetting to a Unix-like server system or a network device (such as a router) and obtaining a login prompt to a command line text interface or a character-based full-screen manager.",protocol,1969,NA,NA,NA,661,NA,NA,NA,6990,0,NA

TI-BASIC,"TI-BASIC is the official name of a BASIC-like language built into Texas Instruments (TI)'s graphing calculators, including the TI-83 series, TI-84 Plus series, TI-89 series, TI-92 series (including Voyage 200), TI-73, and TI-Nspire. TI rarely refers to the language by name, but the name TI-BASIC has been used in some developer documentation. For many applications, it is the most convenient way to program any TI calculator, since the capability to write programs in TI-BASIC is built-in. Assembly language (often referred to as ""asm"") can also be used, and C compilers exist for translation into assembly: TIGCC for Motorola 68000 (68k) based calculators, and SDCC for Zilog Z80 based calculators. However, both of them are cross-compilers, not allowing on-calculator programming. TI-BASIC is considerably slower than the assembly language (because it has to be interpreted), making it better suited to writing programs to quickly solve math problems or perform repetitive tasks, rather than programming games or graphics-intensive applications. Some math instruction books even provide programs in TI-BASIC (usually for the widespread variant used by the TI-82/83/84 series). Although it is somewhat minimalist compared to programming languages used on computers, TI-BASIC is nonetheless an important factor in the programming community. Because TI graphing calculators are required for advanced mathematics classes in many high schools and universities, TI-BASIC often provides the first glimpse many students have into the world of programming.",Programming Language,1970,NA,NA,NA,670,NA,NA,NA,515,0,NA

Apple employees, including Randy Wigginton, adapted Microsoft's interpreter for the Apple II and added several features. The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 on cassette tape and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics. Applesoft II, which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978.

In the base classification, the code set allows for more than 14,000 different codes and permits the tracking of many new diagnoses compared to the preceding ICD-9. Through the use of optional sub-classifications ICD-10 allows for specificity regarding the cause, manifestation, location, severity and type of injury or disease. The adapted versions may differ in a number of ways, and some national editions have expanded the code set even further; with some going so far as to add procedure codes. ICD-10-CM, for example, has over 70,000 codes.The WHO provides detailed information regarding the ICD via its website – including an ICD-10 online browser and ICD training materials.

DIGITAL Command Language,"DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) is the standard command language adopted by most of the operating systems (OSs) that were sold by the former Digital Equipment Corporation (which was acquired by Compaq, which was in turn acquired by Hewlett-Packard).

Written when the programming language Fortran was in heavy use, DCL is a scripting language supporting several datatypes, including strings, integers, bit arrays, arrays and booleans, but not floating point numbers. Access to OpenVMS system services (kernel API) is through lexical functions, which perform the same as their compiled language counterparts and allow scripts to get information on system state. DCL includes IF-THEN-ELSE, access to all the Record Management Services (RMS) file types including stream, indexed, and sequential, but unfortunately lacks a DO-WHILE or other looping construct, requiring users to make do with IF and GOTO-label statements instead. DCL is available for other operating systems as well, including VCL and VX/DCL for Unix, VCL for Unix, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Windows, and PC-DCL and Accelr8 DCL Lite for Windows.

Pop-11,"POP-11 is a reflective, incrementally compiled programming language with many of the features of an interpreted language. It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex, and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham which hosts the Poplog website. POP-11 is an evolution of the language POP-2, developed in Edinburgh University and features an open stack model (like Forth, among others). It is mainly procedural, but supports declarative language constructs, including a pattern matcher and is mostly used for research and teaching in Artificial Intelligence, although it has features sufficient for many other classes of problems. It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal, who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp. One of POP-11's features is that it supports first-class functions. Pop-11 is the core language of the Poplog system. The fact that the compiler and compiler subroutines are available at run-time (a requirement for incremental compilation) gives it the ability to support a far wider range of extensions than would be possible using only a macro facility. This made it possible for incremental compilers to be added for Prolog, Common Lisp and Standard ML, which could be added as required to support either mixed language development or development in the second language without using any Pop-11 constructs. This made it possible for Poplog to be used by teachers, researchers, or developers who were interested in only one of the languages. The most successful product developed in Pop-11 was the Clementine data-mining system, developed by ISL, as described in the entry on Poplog. After SPSS bought ISL they decided to port Clementine to C++ and Java, and eventually succeeded with great effort (and perhaps some loss of the flexibility provided by the use of an AI language!). As explained in the entries for Poplog and POP-2, Pop-11 was for a time available only as part of an expensive commercial package (Poplog), but since about 1999 it has been freely available as part of the Open Source version of Poplog, including various additional packages and teaching libraries. An online version of ELIZA using Pop-11 is available at Birmingham. At the University of Sussex David Young used Pop-11 in combination with C and Fortran to develop a suite of teaching and interactive development tools for image processing and vision, and has made them available in the Popvision extension to Poplog.",Programming Language,1999,NA,NA,NA,683,NA,NA,NA,110,0,University of Sussex

UPC,"Unified Parallel C (UPC) is an extension of the C programming language designed for high-performance computing on large-scale parallel machines, including those with a common global address space (SMP and NUMA) and those with distributed memory (e.g. clusters). The programmer is presented with a single shared, partitioned address space, where variables may be directly read and written by any processor, but each variable is physically associated with a single processor. UPC uses a single program, multiple data (SPMD) model of computation in which the amount of parallelism is fixed at program startup time, typically with a single thread of execution per processor. In order to express parallelism, UPC extends ISO C 99 with the following constructs:  An explicitly parallel execution model A shared address space Synchronization primitives and a memory consistency model Explicit communication primitives, e.g. upc_memput Memory management primitivesThe UPC language evolved from experiences with three other earlier languages that proposed parallel extensions to ISO C 99: AC, Split-C, and Parallel C preprocessor (PCP). UPC is not a superset of these three languages, but rather an attempt to distill the best characteristics of each.

The language is an example of a little language originally intended for the comfort of non-programmers in the Unix environment (Bentley 1988). Pic was first implemented, and is still most typically used, as a preprocessor in the troff document processing system.  The pic preprocessor filters a troff document, replacing diagram descriptions by concrete drawing commands, and passing the rest of the document through without change. A version of pic is included in groff, the GNU version of troff.  GNU pic can also act as a preprocessor for TeX documents, emitting its own tpic DVI specials, which aren't as widely supported as those of other TeX drivers (like PostScript).  Arbitrary diagram text can be included for formatting by the word processor to which the pic output is directed, and arbitrary post-processor commands can also be included. Dwight Aplevich's implementation, DPIC, can also generate postscript or svg images by itself, as well as act as a preprocessor. The three principal sources of pic processors are GNU pic, found on many Linux systems, and dpic, both of which are free, and the original AT&T pic.

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport,"MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a ""small code footprint"" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link authored the first version of the protocol in 1999.In 2013, IBM submitted MQTT v3.1 to the OASIS specification body with a charter that ensured only minor changes to the specification could be accepted. MQTT-SN is a variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP networks, such as Zigbee. Historically, the ""MQ"" in ""MQTT"" came from the IBM MQ (then 'MQSeries') message queuing product line. However, queuing itself is not required to be supported as a standard feature in all situations.Alternative message-oriented middleware includes the  Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP),  Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), the IETF Constrained Application Protocol, XMPP, DDS, OPC UA, and Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP).",protocol,1999,NA,http://mqtt.org/,NA,710,NA,NA,NA,5661,0,Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards

Euclidean geometry,"Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.For more than two thousand years, the adjective ""Euclidean"" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  gravitational field).Euclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of coordinates to specify those objects. This is in contrast to analytic geometry, which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.",notation,-300,NA,NA,NA,715,NA,NA,NA,5440,0,NA

SAML is also:  A set of XML-based protocol messages A set of protocol message bindings A set of profiles (utilizing all of the above)The single most important use case that SAML addresses is web browser single sign-on (SSO). Single sign-on is relatively easy to accomplish within a security domain (using cookies, for example) but extending SSO across security domains is more difficult and resulted in the proliferation of non-interoperable proprietary technologies. The SAML Web Browser SSO profile was specified and standardized to promote interoperability.

Dartmouth BASIC,"Dartmouth BASIC is the original version of the BASIC programming language.  It is so named because it was designed and implemented at Dartmouth College by John Kemény and Thomas Kurtz. It was developed as part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) and was one of the first programming languages intended to be used interactively. Several versions were produced at Dartmouth over the years, all implemented as compile and go compilers. They were implemented by teams of undergraduate programmers working for Kemény and Kurtz.  The first version ran on 1 May 1964, and it was opened to general users in June; upgrades followed, culminating in the seventh release in 1979. Dartmouth also introduced a dramatically updated version known as Structured BASIC (or SBASIC) in 1975, which added various structured programming concepts. SBASIC formed the basis of the ANSI-standard Standard BASIC efforts in the early 1980s. Most dialects of BASIC, notably Microsoft BASIC (MS BASIC), can trace their history to the Fifth Edition. In contrast to the Dartmouth compilers, most other BASICs were written as interpreters. They also lack some of the more advanced features, notably the matrix math commands. Cutting these features allowed these versions to run in the very small main memory of early microcomputers. By the early 1980s, tens of millions of home computers were running some variant of the MS interpreter. It became the de facto standard for BASIC, which led to the abandonment of the ANSI SBASIC efforts. Kemény and Kurtz later left Dartmouth to develop and promote a version of SBASIC known as True BASIC. Many of the early computer games of the mainframe computer era trace their history to Dartmouth BASIC and the DTSS system. A selection of these were collected, in HP 2000 versions, in the People's Computer Company book What to do after you hit Return. Many of the original source listings in BASIC Computer Games and related works also trace their history to Dartmouth BASIC.",Programming Language,1964,John G. Kemeny and Thomas E.

Binary notation,"A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often ""0"" and ""1"" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc. For example, a binary string of eight bits can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items. In computing and telecommunications, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width or variable-width strings. In a fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that bit string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation. There are many character sets and many character encodings for them. A bit string, interpreted as a binary number, can be translated into a decimal number. For example, the lower case a, if represented by the bit string 01100001 (as it is in the standard ASCII code), can also be represented as the decimal number ""97"".",notation,1689,Gottfried Leibniz,NA,https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/05/dropping-in-on-gottfried-leibniz/,732,NA,NA,NA,4715,0,NA

Refal,"Refal (Recursive functions algorithmic language) ""is functional programming language oriented toward symbol manipulation"", including ""string processing, translation, [and] artificial intelligence"". It is one of the oldest members of this family, first conceived in 1966 as a theoretical tool with the first implementation appearing in 1968. Refal was intended to combine mathematical simplicity with practicality for writing large and sophisticated programs. Unlike other functional programming languages, Refal is based on pattern matching. Its pattern matching works in the forward direction rather than backwards (starting from the goal) as in Prolog. The basic data structure of Lisp and Prolog is a linear list consed up from the beginning. Refal lists are built and scanned from both ends, and pattern matching allows to match against nested lists as well as the top-level one. (In effect, the basic data structure of Refal is a tree rather than a list). According to the authors, this gives freedom and convenience in creating data structures while using only mathematically simple control mechanisms of pattern matching and substitution. Refal also includes a feature called the freezer to support efficient partial evaluation. Refal can be applied to the processing and transformation of tree structures, similarly to XSLT.",Programming Language,1968,Valentin Turchin,http://www.refal.net,NA,756,NA,Yes,*,101,0,http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/TURCHIN.html

TELCOMP,"TELCOMP was a programming language developed at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) in about 1964 and in use until at least 1974. BBN offered TELCOMP as a paid service, with first revenue in October 1965.  The service was sold to a company called On-Line Systems in 1972.  In the United Kingdom, TELCOMP was offered by Time Sharing, Ltd, a partnership between BBN and an entrepreneur named Richard Evans. It was an interactive, conversational language based on JOSS, developed by BBN after Cliff Shaw from RAND visited the labs in 1964 as part of the NIH survey.  It was first implemented on the PDP-1 and was used to provide a commercial time sharing service by BBN in the Boston area and later by Time Sharing Ltd. in the United Kingdom. In 1996, Leo Beranek said ""We even developed a programming language called TELCOMP that to this day, some say was better than the programming language that the industry adopted, namely BASIC.""There were at least three versions: TELCOMP I, TELCOMP II, and TELCOMP III. TELCOMP I was implemented on the PDP-1, TELCOMP II on the PDP-7 and TELCOMP III on the PDP-10, running on DEC 's TOPS-10 operating system or on BBN's own TENEX operating system. TELCOMP programs were normally input via a paper tape reader on a Teletype Model 33, which would be connected to a PDP via a modem and acoustic telephone line.  Data could be read from the paper tape reader or from the Teletype keyboard.  Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the paper tape punch.  Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data. During data input using a Teletype, the user would type a response to a printed prompt. If, instead of hitting Return, the user hit Tab, another, possibly computed, prompt would be printed on the same line.  This process could be repeated for the full width of the line. This unusual feature allowed very compact data entry, comparable to full-screen CRT data entry.  It saved paper, and the input section of the form became part of the program's printed output. A later derivative of TELCOMP called STRINGCOMP was oriented towards string handling.  Another BBN JOSS-derivative called FILECOMP was developed for the GE MEDINET system, which was cancelled. The implicit file handling system it contained was influential on the MUMPS global database system. The initial research for LOGO was carried out in TELCOMP, but only the JOSS-style errors and interaction made it through to the actual language.",Programming Language,1966,NA,NA,NA,772,NA,NA,NA,50,0,NA

He always considered the language an incomplete research project, and although he released many papers about its design, he continued to claim legal restrictions on its use. Because of this, a group of his followers later formed the Logical Language Group to create the language Lojban along the same principles, but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language. Supporters of Lojban use the term Loglan as a generic term to refer to both their own language, and Brown's Loglan, referred to as ""TLI Loglan"" when in need of disambiguation. Although the non-trademarkability of the term Loglan was eventually upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, many supporters and members of The Loglan Institute find this usage offensive, and reserve Loglan for the TLI version of the language.",Programming Language,1982,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/47f155eaa3f41f9f53995976949bec6c61325439,775,NA,NA,NA,3515,0,Institute of Informatics

SQL/PSM,"SQL/PSM (SQL/Persistent Stored Modules) is an ISO standard mainly defining an extension of SQL with a procedural language for use in stored procedures. Initially published in 1996 as an extension of SQL-92 (ISO/IEC 9075-4:1996, a version sometimes called PSM-96 or even SQL-92/PSM), SQL/PSM was later incorporated into the multi-part SQL:1999 standard, and has been part 4 of that standard since then, most recently in SQL:2016.  The SQL:1999 part 4 covered less than the original PSM-96 because the SQL statements for defining, managing, and invoking routines were actually incorporated into part 2 SQL/Foundation, leaving only the procedural language itself as SQL/PSM. The SQL/PSM facilities are still optional as far as the SQL standard is concerned; most of them are grouped in Features P001-P008. SQL/PSM standardizes syntax and semantics for control flow, exception handling (called ""condition handling"" in SQL/PSM), local variables, assignment of expressions to variables and parameters, and (procedural) use of cursors. It also defines an information schema (metadata) for stored procedures.  SQL/PSM is one language in which methods for the SQL:1999 structured types can be defined.  The other is Java, via SQL/JRT. IBM's SQL PL (used in DB2) and Mimer SQL's PSM were the first two products implementing SQL/PSM. In practice those two, and perhaps also MySQL/MariaDB's procedural language, are closest to the SQL/PSM standard. SQL/PSM resembles and is inspired by PL/SQL, as well as PL/pgSQL, so they are similar languages.  With PostgreSQL v9 some SQL/PSM features, like overloading of SQL-invoked functions and procedures are now supported.  A PostgreSQL addon implements SQL/PSM (alongside its own procedural language), although it is not part of the core product.RDF functionality in OpenLink Virtuoso was developed entirely through SQL/PSM, combined with custom datatypes (e.g., ANY for handling URI and Literal relation objects), sophisticated indexing, and flexible physical storage choices (column-wise or row-wise).",Programming Language,1996,NA,NA,NA,784,NA,NA,NA,225,0,NA

RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).   RTP is used in conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids synchronization of multiple streams. RTP is one of the technical foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in conjunction with a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network. RTP was developed by the Audio-Video Transport Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and first published in 1996 as RFC 1889, superseded by RFC 3550 in 2003.",protocol,1996,NA,NA,NA,788,NA,NA,NA,3325,0,NA

It was invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by Indian mathematicians. The system was adopted in Arabic mathematics by the 9th century. Influential were the books of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, c. 825) and Al-Kindi (On the Use of the Hindu Numerals, c. 830).  The system later spread to medieval Europe by the High Middle Ages. The system is based upon ten (originally nine) glyphs. The symbols (glyphs) used to represent the system are in principle independent of the system itself. The glyphs in actual use are descended from Brahmi numerals and have split into various typographical variants since the Middle Ages. These symbol sets can be divided into three main families: Western Arabic numerals used in the Greater Maghreb and in Europe, Eastern Arabic numerals (also called ""Indic numerals"") used in the Middle East, and the Indian numerals used in the Indian subcontinent.",numeralSystem,825,NA,NA,NA,789,NA,NA,NA,3300,0,NA

ARC processor,"ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors are a family of 32-bit CPUs originally designed by ARC International. They are widely used in SoC devices for storage, home, mobile, automotive, and Internet of Things applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 organizations and are shipped in more than 1.5 billion products per year. ARC processors are now part of the Synopsys DesignWare series, and can be optimized for a wide range of uses. Designers can differentiate their products by using patented configuration technology to tailor each ARC processor instance to meet specific performance, power and area requirements. The ARC processors are also extendable, allowing designers to add their own custom instructions that can significantly increase performance or reduce power consumption. ARC processors are RISC processors, and employ the 16-/32-bit ARCompact instruction set architecture that provides good performance and code density for embedded and host SoC applications. The processors are synthesizable and can be implemented in any foundry or process, and are supported by a complete suite of development tools. Configuration of the ARC processors occurs at design time, using the ARChitect processor configurator. The core was designed to be extensible. Unlike most embedded microprocessors, extra instructions, registers and functionality can be added, in a modular fashion. Customers analyse the task, break down the operations, and then choose the appropriate extensions, or develop their own, to create their own custom microprocessor. They might optimise for speed, energy efficiency or code density. Extensions can include, for example, an MMU, a fast multiplier–accumulator, a USB Host, a Viterbi path decoder, or a user's proprietary RTL functions. The ARC concept was developed initially within Argonaut Games through a series of 3D pipeline development projects starting with the Super FX chip for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1995, Argonaut was split into Argonaut Technologies Limited (ATL), which had a variety of technology projects, and Argonaut Software Limited (ASL). At the start of 1996, the General Manager of Argonaut, John Edelson, started reducing ATL projects such as BRender and motion capture and investing in the development of the ARC concept. In 1997, following investment by Apax Partners, ATL became ARC International and totally independent from Argonaut Games. Prior to their initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and five other investment banks, three related technology companies were acquired: Metaware in Santa Cruz, California (development and modeling software), VAutomation in Nashua, New Hampshire (peripheral semiconductor IP), and Precise Software in Nepean, Ontario (RTOS).",isa,1995,NA,NA,NA,791,NA,NA,NA,505,0,ARC International PLC
CLIST,"CLIST (Command List) (pronounced ""C-List"") is a procedural programming language for TSO in MVS systems. It originated in OS/360 Release 20 and has assumed a secondary role since the availability of Rexx in TSO/E Version 2. The term CLIST is also used for command lists written by users of NetView.In its basic form, a CLIST program (or ""CLIST"" for short) can take the form of a simple list of commands to be executed in strict sequence (like a DOS batch file (*.bat) file).  However, CLIST also features If-Then-Else logic as well as loop constructs. CLIST is an interpreted language.  That is, the computer must translate a CLIST every time the program is executed.  CLISTs therefore tend to be slower than programs written in compiled languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN, or PL/1.  (A program written in a compiled language is translated once to create a ""load module"" or executable.) CLIST can read/write MVS files and read/write from/to a TSO terminal. It can read parameters from the caller and also features a function to hold global variables and pass them between CLISTs. A CLIST can also call an MVS application program (written in COBOL or  PL/I, for example). CLISTs can be run in background (by running JCL which executes the TSO control program (IKJEFT01)). TSO I/O screens and menus using ISPF dialog services can be displayed by CLISTs. Compare the function of CLIST with that provided by REXX.",Programming Language,1990,NA,NA,NA,792,NA,Yes,NA,125,0,IBM

Qalb,"قلب (Levantine Arabic: [ʔalb]), transliterated Qalb, Qlb and Alb, is a functional programming language allowing a programmer to write programs completely in Arabic. Its name means heart and is a recursive acronym in Arabic meaning Qlb: a programming language (قلب: لغة برمجة, Qlb: Lughat Barmajah). It was developed in 2012 by Ramsey Nasser, a computer scientist at the Eyebeam Art + Technology Center in New York City, as both an artistic endeavor and as a response to the Anglophone bias in the vast majority of programming languages, which express their fundamental concepts using English words. The syntax is like that of Lisp or Scheme, consisting of parenthesized lists. All keywords are appropriate Arabic terms, and program text is laid out right-to-left, like all Arabic text. The language provides a minimal set of primitives for defining functions, conditionals, looping, list manipulation, and basic arithmetic expressions. It is Turing-complete, and the Fibonacci sequence and Conway's Game of Life have been implemented. Because all program text is written in Arabic, and the connecting strokes between characters in the Arabic script can be extended to any length, it is possible to align the source code in artistic patterns, in the tradition of Arabic calligraphy.

Speakeasy,"Speakeasy is a numerical computing interactive environment also featuring an interpreted programming language. It was initially developed for internal use at the Physics Division of Argonne National Laboratory by the theoretical physicist Stanley Cohen. He eventually founded Speakeasy Computing Corporation to make the program available commercially. Speakeasy is a very long-lasting numerical package. In fact, the original version of the environment was built around a core dynamic data repository called ""Named storage"" developed in the early 1960s, while the most recent version has been released in 2006. Speakeasy was aimed to make the computational work of the physicists at the Argonne National Laboratory easier. It was initially conceived to work on mainframes (the only kind of computers at that time), and was subsequently ported to new platforms (minicomputers, personal computers) as they became available. The porting of the same code on different platforms was made easier by using Mortran metalanguage macros to face systems dependencies and compilers deficiencies and differences. Speakeasy is currently available on several platforms : PCs running Windows, macOS, Linux, departmental computers and workstations running several flavors of Linux, AIX or Solaris. Speakeasy was also among the first interactive numerical computing environments, having been implemented in such a way on a CDC 3600 system, and later on IBM TSO machines as one was in beta-testing at the Argonne National Laboratory at the time. Almost since the beginning (as the dynamic linking functionality was made available in the operating systems) Speakeasy features the capability of expanding its operational vocabulary using separated modules, dynamically linked to the core processor as they are needed. For that reason such modules  were called ""linkules"" (LINKable-modULES). They are functions with a generalized interface, which can be written in  FORTRAN or in C. The independence of each of the new modules from the others and from the main processor is of great help in improving the system, especially it was in the old days. This easy way of expanding the functionalities of the main processor was often exploited by the users to develop their own specialized packages. Besides the programs, functions and subroutines the user can write in the Speakeasy's own interpreted language, linkules add functionalities carried out with the typical performances of compiled programs. Among the packages developed by the users, one of the most important is ""Modeleasy"", originally developed as ""FEDeasy"" in the early 1970s at the research department of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington D.C.. Modeleasy implements special objects and functions for large econometric models estimation and simulation. Its evolution led eventually to its distribution as an independent product.",Programming Language,2006,Stanley Cohen,http://speakeasy.com,NA,804,NA,NA,NA,96,0,NA

BLISS,"BLISS is a system programming language developed at Carnegie Mellon University by W. A. Wulf, D. B. Russell, and A. N. Habermann around 1970. It was perhaps the best known systems programming language right up until C made its debut a few years later. Since then, C took off and BLISS faded into obscurity. When C was in its infancy, a few projects within Bell Labs were debating the merits of BLISS vs. C. BLISS is a typeless block-structured language based on expressions rather than statements, and includes constructs for exception handling, coroutines, and macros. It does not include a goto statement. The name is variously said to be short for ""Basic Language for Implementation of System Software"" or ""System Software Implementation Language, Backwards"". It was sometimes called ""Bill's Language for Implementing System Software"", after Bill Wulf. The original Carnegie Mellon compiler was notable for its extensive use of optimizations, and formed the basis of the classic book The Design of an Optimizing Compiler. DEC developed and maintained BLISS compilers for the PDP-10, PDP-11, VAX, DEC Prism, MIPS, DEC Alpha, and Intel IA-32, The language did not become popular among customers and few had the compiler, but DEC used it heavily in-house into the 1980s; most of the utility programs for the VMS operating system were written in BLISS-32.

Jargon,"Jargon is a type of language that is used in a particular context and may not be well understood outside that context. The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, or academic field), but any in group can have jargon. The main trait that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is special vocabulary—including some words specific to it, and often different senses or meanings of words, that out groups would tend to take in another sense—therefore misunderstanding that communication attempt. Jargon is thus ""the technical terminology or characteristic idiom of a special activity or group"". Most jargon is technical terminology, involving terms of art or industry terms, with particular meaning within a specific industry. A main driving force in the creation of technical jargon is precision and efficiency of communication when a discussion must easily range from general themes to specific, finely differentiated details without circumlocution. A side-effect of this is a higher threshold for comprehensibility, which is usually accepted as a trade-off but is sometimes even used as a means of social exclusion (reinforcing ingroup-outgroup barriers) or social aspiration (when intended as a way of showing off). The philosopher Étienne Bonnot de Condillac observed in 1782 that ""every science requires a special language because every science has its own ideas"". As a rationalist member of the Enlightenment, he continued: ""It seems that one ought to begin by composing this language, but people begin by speaking and writing, and the language remains to be composed.""Various kinds of language peculiar to ingroups can be named across a semantic field. Slang can be either culture-wide or known only within a certain group or subculture. Argot is slang or jargon purposely used to obscure meaning to outsiders. Conversely, a lingua franca is used for the opposite effect, helping communicators to overcome unintelligibility, as are pidgins and creole languages. For example, the Chinook Jargon was a pidgin. Although technical jargon's primary purpose is to aid technical communication, not to exclude outsiders by serving as an argot, it can have both effects at once and can provide a technical ingroup with shibboleths. For example, medieval guilds could use this as one means of informal protectionism. On the other hand, jargon that once was obscure outside a small ingroup can become generally known over time. For example, the terms bit, byte, and hexadecimal (which are terms from computing jargon) are now recognized by many people outside computer science.",Programming Language,1987,NA,NA,https://joewing.net/projects/jargon/,811,NA,NA,NA,2955,0,NA

Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines, generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a ""scribble"". Doodling and scribbling are most often associated with young children and toddlers, because their lack of hand–eye coordination and lower mental development often make it very difficult for any young child to keep their coloring attempts within the line art of the subject. Despite this, it is not uncommon to see such behaviour with adults, in which case it is generally done jovially, out of boredom. Typical examples of doodling are found in school notebooks, often in the margins, drawn by students daydreaming or losing interest during class. Other common examples of doodling are produced during long telephone conversations if a pen and paper are available.

The language was called PROGRESS or Progress 4GL up until version 9, but in 2006 PSC changed the name to OpenEdge Advanced Business Language (OpenEdge ABL) in order to overcome a presumed industry perception that 4GLs were less capable than other languages. A subset of the language, called SpeedScript, is used in the development of web applications.OpenEdge ABL helps developers to develop applications optionally using its own integrated relational database and programming tool. These applications are portable across computing systems and allow access to various popular data sources without having to learn the underlying data access methods. This means that the end-user of these products can be unaware of the underlying architecture. By combining a fourth generation language and relational database, OpenEdge ABL allows the use of the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model for developing software. A programmer and even end users can do rapid prototyping using the integrated and GUI tools of the development environment.",Programming Language,2006,NA,NA,NA,820,p cls w,Yes,NA,710,0,Progress Software Corporation

Gopher,"The Gopher protocol  is a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. The Gopher protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document design and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) became the dominant protocol. The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.The protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P. McCahill at the University of Minnesota.  It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote text-oriented computer terminals, which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations. More recent Gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia. Gopher was preferred by many network administrators for using fewer network resources than Web services.Gopher's hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large-scale electronic library connections. Gopher has been described by some enthusiasts as ""faster and more efficient and so much more organized"" than today's Web services. The Gopher protocol is still in use by enthusiasts, and although it has been almost entirely supplanted by the Web, a small population of actively-maintained servers remains.",protocol,1991,Mark P.

MVEL,"MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) is a hybrid dynamic/statically typed, embeddable Expression Language and runtime for the Java Platform.  Originally started as a utility language for an application framework, the project is now developed completely independently. MVEL is typically used for exposing basic logic to end-users and programmers through configuration such as XML files or annotations.  It may also be used to parse simple JavaBean expressions. The runtime allows MVEL expressions to be executed either interpretively, or through a pre-compilation process with support for runtime bytecode generation to remove overhead. Since MVEL is meant to augment Java-based software, it borrows most of its syntax directly from the Java programming language with some minor differences and additional capabilities. For example: as a side effect of MVEL's typing model, which treats class and method references as regular variables, it is possible to use both class and function pointers (but only for static methods).  MVEL also allows collections to be represented as folds (or projections) in a Lisp-like syntax.",Programming Language,2003,NA,NA,NA,852,NA,Yes,//,235,0,https://github.com/mvel
Speedcoding,"Speedcoding or Speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an IBM computer. The language was developed by John Backus in 1953 for the IBM 701 to support computation with  floating point numbers. Here high level means symbolic and aiming for natural language expressivity as a goal as opposed to machine or hardware instruction oriented coding. The idea arose from the difficulty of programming the IBM SSEC machine when Backus was hired to calculate astronomical positions in early 1950. The speedcoding system was an interpreter and focused on ease of use at the expense of system resources. It provided pseudo-instructions for common mathematical functions: logarithms, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations. The resident software analyzed pseudo-instructions one by one and called the appropriate subroutine. Speedcoding was also the first implementation of decimal input/output operations. Although it substantially reduced the effort of writing many jobs, the running time of a program that was written with the help of Speedcoding was usually ten to twenty times that of machine code. The interpreter took 310 memory words, about 30% of the memory available on a 701.",Programming Language,1953,John Backus,NA,NA,853,NA,NA,NA,335,0,NA
SSI,"Server Side Includes (SSI) is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used almost exclusively for the Web. Code is processed by web servers. The most frequent use of SSI is to include the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server. For example, a web page containing a daily quotation could include the quotation by placing the following code into the file of the web page:  With one change of the quote.txt file, all pages that include the file will display the latest daily quotation. The inclusion is not limited to files, and may also be the text output from a program, or the value of a system variable such as the current time. Server Side Includes are useful for including a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a navigation menu. Conditional navigation menus can be conditionally included using control directives. In order for a web server to recognize an SSI-enabled HTML file and therefore carry out these instructions, either the filename should end with a special extension, by default .shtml, .stm, .shtm, or, if the server is configured to allow this, set the execution bit of the file.As a simple programming language, SSI supports only one type: text. Its control flow is rather simple, choice is supported, but loops are not natively supported and can only be done by recursion using include or using HTTP redirect. The simple design of the language makes it easier to learn and use than most server-side scripting languages, while complicated server-side processing is often done with one of the more feature-rich programming languages. SSI is Turing complete.Apache, LiteSpeed, nginx, and IIS are the four major web servers that support this language. SSI has a simple syntax: <!--#directive parameter=value parameter=value -->. Directives are placed in HTML comments so that if SSI is not enabled, users will not see the SSI directives on the page, unless they look at its source. Note that the syntax does not allow spaces between the leading ""<"" and the directive.",template,2004,NA,NA,NA,854,NA,NA,NA,740,0,NA

Query by Example,"Query by Example (QBE) is a database query language for relational databases. It was devised by Moshé M. Zloof at IBM Research during the mid-1970s, in parallel to the development of SQL. It is the first graphical query language, using visual tables where the user would enter commands, example elements and conditions. Many graphical front-ends for databases use the ideas from QBE today. Originally limited only for the purpose of retrieving data, QBE was later extended to allow other operations, such as inserts, deletes and updates, as well as creation of temporary tables. The motivation behind QBE is that a parser can convert the user's actions into statements expressed in a database manipulation language, such as SQL.  Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. A suitably comprehensive front-end can minimize the burden on the user to remember the finer details of SQL, and it is easier and more productive for end-users (and even programmers) to select tables and columns by selecting them rather than typing in their names, In the context of information retrieval, QBE has a somewhat different meaning. The user can submit a document, or several documents, and ask for ""similar"" documents to be retrieved from a document database [see search by multiple examples]. Similarity search is based comparing document vectors (see Vector Space Model). QBE is a seminal work in end-user development, frequently cited in research papers as an early example of this topic. Currently, QBE is supported in several relational database front ends, notably Microsoft Access, which implements ""Visual Query by Example"", as well as Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager. It is also implemented in several object-oriented databases (e.g. in db4o). QBE is based on the logical formalism called tableau query, although QBE adds some extensions to that, much like SQL is based on the relational algebra.",Programming Language,1969,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f320e453ae65ddf0a3789f4383fa164481c7a8b3,866,NA,NA,NA,700,0,IBM

HL7,"Health Level Seven or HL7 refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is ""layer 7"" in the OSI model. The HL7 standards are produced by Health Level Seven International, an international standards organization, and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as American National Standards Institute and International Organization for Standardization. Hospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking.  All of these systems should communicate with each other (or ""interface"") when they receive new information, or when they wish to retrieve information, but not all do so. HL7 International specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.HL7 International considers the following standards to be its primary standards – those standards that are most commonly used and implemented: Version 2.x Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions Version 3 Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) – an exchange model for clinical documents, based on HL7 Version 3 Continuity of Care Document (CCD) – a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.

T,"The T programming language is a dialect of the Scheme programming language developed in the early 1980s by Jonathan A. Rees, Kent M. Pitman, and Norman I. Adams of Yale University as an experiment in language design and implementation. T's purpose is to test the thesis developed by Steele and Sussman in their series of papers about Scheme: that Scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power, and that implementations of Scheme could perform better than other Lisp systems, and competitively with implementations of programming languages, such as C and BLISS, which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than Lisp on conventional machine architectures. In 1987 Stephen Slade published the book ""The T Programming Language: A Dialect of LISP"". T contains some features that modern Scheme does not have. For example, T is object-oriented, and it has first-class environments, called locales, which can be modified non-locally and used as a module system. T has several extra special forms for lazy evaluation and flow control, as well as an equivalent to Common Lisp's setf. T, like Scheme, supports call-with-current-continuation, but it also has a more limited form called catch. From the T manual, a hypothetical implementation of cons could be:  Through this example, we can see that objects in T are intimately related to closures and message-passing. A primitive called join puts two objects together, allowing for something resembling inheritance.",Programming Language,1980,NA,NA,NA,874,NA,NA,NA,125,0,NA
Open Database Connectivity,"In computing, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems (DBMS). The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems. An application written using ODBC can be ported to other platforms, both on the client and server side, with few changes to the data access code. ODBC accomplishes DBMS independence by using an ODBC driver as a translation layer between the application and the DBMS. The application uses ODBC functions through an ODBC driver manager with which it is linked, and the driver passes the query to the DBMS. An ODBC driver can be thought of as analogous to a printer driver or other driver, providing a standard set of functions for the application to use, and implementing DBMS-specific functionality. An application that can use ODBC is referred to as ""ODBC-compliant"". Any ODBC-compliant application can access any DBMS for which a driver is installed.  Drivers exist for all major DBMSs, many other data sources like address book systems and Microsoft Excel, and even for text or comma-separated values (CSV) files. ODBC was originally developed by Microsoft and Simba Technologies during the early 1990s, and became the basis for the Call Level Interface (CLI) standardized by SQL Access Group in the Unix and mainframe field. ODBC retained several features that were removed as part of the CLI effort. Full ODBC was later ported back to those platforms, and became a de facto standard considerably better known than CLI. The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes.",protocol,1990,NA,NA,NA,875,NA,NA,NA,2030,0,Microsoft && Simba Technologies Inc

Pure,"Pure, successor to the equational language Q, is a dynamically typed, functional programming language based on term rewriting. It has facilities for user-defined operator syntax, macros, arbitrary-precision arithmetic (multiple-precision numbers), and compiling to native code through the LLVM. Pure is free and open-source software distributed (mostly) under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later. Pure comes with an interpreter and debugger, provides automatic memory management, has powerful functional and symbolic programming abilities, and interfaces to libraries in C (e.g., for numerics, low-level protocols, and other such tasks). At the same time, Pure is a small language designed from scratch; its interpreter is not large, and the library modules are written in Pure. The syntax of Pure resembles that of Miranda and Haskell, but it is a free-format language and thus uses explicit delimiters (rather than off-side rule indents) to denote program structure. The Pure language is a successor of the equational programming language Q created formerly by the same author, Albert Gräf at the University of Mainz, Germany. Relative to Q, it offers some important new features (such as local functions with lexical scoping, efficient vector and matrix support, and the built-in C interface) and programs run much faster as they are compiled just-in-time to native code on the fly. Pure is mostly aimed at mathematical applications and scientific computing currently, but its interactive interpreter environment, the C interface and the growing set of addon modules make it suitable for a variety of other applications, such as artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, and real-time multimedia processing. Pure plug-ins are available for the Gnumeric spreadsheet and Miller Puckette's Pure Data graphical multimedia software, which make it possible to extend these programs with functions written in the Pure language. Interfaces are also provided as library modules to GNU Octave, OpenCV, OpenGL, the GNU Scientific Library, FAUST, SuperCollider, and liblo (for Open Sound Control (OSC)).",Programming Language,2008,Albert Gräf,https://agraef.github.io/pure-lang/,NA,881,NA,NA,NA,176,0,https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/issues

JOSS,"JOSS (an acronym for JOHNNIAC Open Shop System) was one of the very first interactive, time-sharing programming languages. JOSS I, developed by J. Clifford Shaw at RAND was first implemented, in beta form, on the JOHNNIAC computer in May 1963.  The full implementation was deployed in January 1964, supporting five terminals and the final version, supporting ten terminals, was deployed in January 1965.JOSS was written in a symbolic assembly language called EasyFox (E and F in the US military's phonetic alphabet of that time).  EasyFox was also developed by Cliff Shaw. JOSS was dubbed ""The Helpful Assistant"" for its conversational user interface.  Originally green/black typewriter ribbons were used in its terminals with green being used for user input and black for the computer's response. Mathematically, JOSS was interesting because it stored all numbers as an integer and a decimal exponent. This means calculations were exact decimal values, as opposed to floating point calculations. One third plus one third plus one third was exactly one. Any command that was not understood elicited the response ""Eh?"" or ""SORRY"". JOSS II, was developed by Charles L. Baker, Joseph W. Smith, Irwin D. Greenwald, and G. Edward Bryan for the PDP-6 computer between 1964 and February 1966. Many variants of JOSS were developed and implemented on a variety of platforms.  Some of these variants remained very similar to the original: TELCOMP, FOCAL, CAL, CITRAN, ISIS, PIL/I, JEAN (ICT 1900 series), AID (PDP-10); while others, such as MUMPS, developed in distinctive directions.",Programming Language,1966,Cliff Shaw,NA,NA,888,NA,NA,NA,150,0,RAND Corporation

Mary,"Mary was a programming language designed and implemented by RUNIT at Trondheim, Norway in the 1970s. It borrowed many features from ALGOL 68 but was designed for machine-oriented programming. An unusual feature of its syntax was that expressions were constructed using the conventional infix operators, but all of them had the same precedence and evaluation went from left to right unless there were brackets. Assignment had the destination on the right and assignment was considered just another operator. Similar to C, several language features appear to have existed to allow programmers to produce reasonably well optimised code, despite a quite primitive code generator in the compiler. These included operators similar to the += et alter  in C and explicit register declarations for variables. Notable features:  ""Dataflow syntax"" - values flow from left to right, including assignment. Most constructs could be used in expressions (blocks, IF, CASE, etc.). Text-based recursive macros. Overloaded user-defined operators, not constrained to predefined identifiers as in C++. Automatic building and dereferencing of pointers from type context. Scalar range types. Array and set enumeration in loop iterators. Dynamic array descriptors (ROW).A book describing Mary was printed in 1974 (Fourth and last edition in 1979): Mary Textbook by Reidar Conradi & Per Holager. Compilers were made for Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk's SM-4  and Norsk Data Nord-10/ND-100 mini-computers. The original Mary compiler was written in NU ALGOL, ran on the Univac-1100 series and was used to bootstrap a native compiler for ND-100/SINTRAN-III. RUNIT implemented a CHILL compiler written in Mary which ran on ND-100 and had Intel 8086 and 80286 targets. When this compiler was ported to the VAX platform, a common backend for Mary and CHILL was implemented. Later, backends for i386 and SPARC were available. Since the Mary compiler was implemented in Mary, it was possible to run the compiler on all these platforms.

Jolie,"Jolie (Java Orchestration Language Interpreter Engine) is an open-source programming language for developing distributed applications based on microservices. In the programming paradigm proposed with Jolie, each program is a service that can communicate with other programs by sending and receiving messages over a network. Jolie supports an abstraction layer that allows services to communicate using different mediums, ranging from TCP/IP sockets to local in-memory communications between processes.Jolie is currently supported by an interpreter implemented in the Java language, which can be run in multiple operating systems including Linux-based operating systems, OS X, and Windows. The language comes with formal semantics, meaning that the execution of Jolie programs is mathematically defined. For this reason, Jolie is used in research for the investigation of language-based techniques for the development of distributed systems, and it is also used for teaching at some Universities.The Jolie open source project was started by Fabrizio Montesi in 2006, as part of his studies at the University of Bologna. The project initially began as an implementation of the SOCK process calculus, a formal model proposed by Claudio Guidi et al. at the University of Bologna inspired by the CCS process calculus and the WS-BPEL programming language. Jolie extends SOCK with support for, e.g., tree-like data structures (inspired by XML, but with a syntax resembling that of C and Java), message types, typed session programming, integration with Java and JavaScript, code mobility, application containment, and web programming. A complete list of the project contributors is available at.The project is currently maintained by Fabrizio Montesi and its evolution is driven by Fabrizio Montesi and Claudio Guidi. Since it supports the orchestration of web services, Jolie is an alternative to XML-based orchestration languages such as WS-BPEL as it offers a concise (C-like) syntax for accessing XML-like data structures.",Programming Language,2006,Claudio Guidi and Fabrizio Montesi,http://jolie-lang.org/,NA,925,ol iol,NA,NA,311,0,University of Bologna

Mesa,"Mesa is a programming language developed in the late 1970s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Palo Alto, California, United States. The language name was a pun based upon the programming language catchphrases of the time, because Mesa is a ""high level"" programming language. Mesa is an ALGOL-like language with strong support for modular programming. Every library module has at least two source files: a definitions file specifying the library's interface plus one or more program files specifying the implementation of the procedures in the interface. To use a library, a program or higher-level library must ""import"" the definitions. The Mesa compiler type-checks all uses of imported entities; this combination of separate compilation with type-checking was unusual at the time.Mesa introduced several other innovations in language design and implementation, notably in the handling of software exceptions, thread synchronization, and incremental compilation. Mesa was developed on the Xerox Alto, one of the first personal computers with a graphical user interface, however most of the Alto's system software was written in BCPL. Mesa was the system programming language of the later Xerox Star workstations, and for the GlobalView desktop environment.  Xerox PARC later developed Cedar, which was a superset of Mesa. Mesa and Cedar had a major influence on the design of other important languages, such as Modula-2 and Java, and was an important vehicle for the development and dissemination of the fundamentals of GUIs, networked environments, and the other advances Xerox contributed to the field of computer science.",Programming Language,1970,NA,NA,NA,927,NA,NA,NA,205,0,Computer Systems Laboratory

Additionally, PASM has automatic garbage collection from the virtual machine, and it does not allow pointer arithmetic.

EGL,"EGL (Enterprise Generation Language), originally developed by IBM and now available as the EDT (EGL Development Tools) Open Source project under the Eclipse Public License (EPL), is a programming technology designed to meet the challenges of modern, multi-platform application development by providing a common language and programming model across languages, frameworks, and runtime platforms. The language borrows concepts familiar to anyone using statically typed languages like Java, COBOL, C, etc. However, it borrows the concept of stereotype from Unified Modeling Language (UML) that is not typically found in statically typed programming languages. In a nutshell, EGL is a higher-level, universal application development language. EGL is similar in syntax to other common languages so it can be learned by application developers with similar previous programming background. EGL application development abstractions shield programmers from the technical interfaces of systems and middleware allowing them to focus on building business functionality. EGL applications and services are written, tested and debugged at the EGL source level, and once they are satisfactorily functionally tested they can be compiled into COBOL, Java, or JavaScript code to support deployment of business applications that can run in any of the following environments: Platforms with a Java virtual machine, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and UNIX, for example in the context of a Java EE servlet container (IBM WebSphere Application Server, Apache Tomcat, GlassFish) IBM System z: CICS Transaction Server, IMS, z/OS Batch, UNIX System Services, WebSphere Application Server, z/VSE, Linux IBM System i: IBM i5/OS, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Apache Tomcat, Integrated Web Application Server for i Web browsers supporting JavaScript, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, for Ajax rich web applications",Programming Language,2008,NA,NA,NA,995,NA,NA,NA,150,0,IBM

MXML,"MXML is an XML-based user interface markup language first introduced by Macromedia in March 2004. Application developers use MXML in combination with ActionScript to develop rich Internet applications, with products such as Apache Flex. Adobe Systems, which acquired Macromedia in December 2005, gives no official meaning for the acronym MXML. Some developers suggest it should stand for ""Magic eXtensible Markup Language"" (which is a backronym). It is likely that the name comes from the MX suffix given to Macromedia Studio products released in 2002 and 2004, or simply ""Macromedia eXtensible Markup Language"". MXML is used mainly to declaratively lay out the interface of applications and can also be used to implement business logic and internet application behaviors. It can contain chunks of ActionScript code, either when creating the body of an event handler function, or with data binding where the curly braces ({) syntax is used. MXML is often used with Flex Server, which dynamically compiles it into standard binary SWF files. However, the Adobe Flash Builder IDE (formerly Adobe Flex Builder) and free Flex SDK can also compile MXML into SWF files without the use of a Flex Server. There is also a PHP PEAR package called XML_MXML, which is a framework to build Adobe Flex applications. MXML is considered a proprietary standard due to its tight integration with Adobe technologies.  It is like XAML in this respect.  No published translators exist for converting an MXML document to another user interface language such as UIML, XUL, XForms, XAML, or SVG. However, there do exist third party vendor plugins for Flex Builder that are capable of generating a result other than a SWF file from Flex applications, for instance native mobile applications.",xmlFormat,2004,NA,NA,NA,1005,NA,NA,NA,180,0,Adobe Inc

XBRL,"XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a freely available and global framework for exchanging business information.  XBRL allows the expression of semantic meaning commonly required in business reporting. The language is XML-based and uses the XML syntax and related XML technologies such as XML Schema, XLink, XPath, and Namespaces. One use of XBRL is to define and exchange financial information, such as a financial statement. The XBRL Specification is developed and published by XBRL International, Inc. (XII). XBRL is a standards-based way to communicate and exchange business information between business systems. These communications are defined by metadata set out in taxonomies, which capture the definition of individual reporting concepts as well as the relationships between concepts and other semantic meaning.  Information being communicated or exchanged is provided within an XBRL instance. Early users of XBRL included regulators such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS).   Common functions in many countries that make use of XBRL include regulators of stock exchanges and securities, banking regulators, business registrars, revenue reporting and tax-filing agencies, and national statistical agencies. A wiki repository of XBRL projects is available to be freely explored and updated. Within the last ten years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United Kingdom's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and Singapore's Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), had begun to require companies to use it, and other regulators were following suit. Development of the SEC's initial US GAAP Taxonomy was led by XBRL US and was accepted and deployed for use by public companies in 2008 in phases, with the largest filers going first: foreign companies which use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are expected to submit their financial returns to the SEC using XBRL once the IFRS taxonomy has been accepted by the SEC. In the UK in 2011, both HMRC and Companies House accepted XBRL in the iXBRL format.

ACL2,"ACL2 (A Computational Logic for Applicative Common Lisp) is a software system consisting of a programming language, an extensible theory in a first-order logic, and an automated theorem prover.  ACL2 is designed to support automated reasoning in inductive logical theories, mostly for the purpose of software and hardware verification.  The input language and implementation of ACL2 are built on Common Lisp.  ACL2 is free, open source (BSD license) software. The ACL2 programming language is an applicative (side-effect free) variant of Common Lisp.  ACL2 is untyped. All ACL2 functions are total — that is, every function maps each object in the ACL2 universe to another object in its universe. ACL2's base theory axiomatizes the semantics of its programming language and its built-in functions.  User definitions in the programming language that satisfy a definitional principle extend the theory in a way that maintains the theory's logical consistency. The core of ACL2's theorem prover is based on term rewriting, and this core is extensible in that user-discovered theorems can be used as ad-hoc proof techniques for subsequent conjectures. ACL2 is intended to be an ""industrial strength"" version of the Boyer–Moore theorem prover, NQTHM.  Toward this goal, ACL2 has many features to support clean engineering of interesting mathematical and computational theories.  ACL2 also derives efficiency from being built on Common Lisp; for example, the same specification that is the basis for inductive verification can be compiled and run natively. In 2005, the authors of the Boyer-Moore family of provers, which includes ACL2, received the ACM Software System Award ""for pioneering and engineering a most effective theorem prover (...) as a formal methods tool for verifying safety-critical hardware and software.""",Programming Language,1990,Robert S.

The ""Revolution"" development system was based on the MetaCard engine technology which Runtime Revolution later acquired from MetaCard Corporation in 2003. The platform won the Macworld Annual Editor's Choice Award for ""Best Development Software"" in 2004.  ""Revolution"" was renamed ""LiveCode"" in the fall of 2010.  ""LiveCode"" is developed and sold by Runtime Revolution Ltd., based in Edinburgh, Scotland. In March, 2015, the company was renamed ""LiveCode Ltd."", to unify the company name with the product. In April 2013 a free/open source version 'LiveCode Community Edition 6.0' was published after a successful crowdfunding campaign at Kickstarter. The code base was re-licensed and made available as free and open source software with a version in April 2013. LiveCode runs on iOS, Android, OS X, Windows 95 through Windows 10, Raspberry Pi and several variations of Unix, including Linux, Solaris, and BSD. It can be used for mobile, desktop and server/CGI applications. The iOS (iPhone and iPad) version was released in December 2010. The first version to deploy to the Web was released in 2009. It is the most widely used HyperCard/HyperTalk clone, and the only one that runs on all major operating systems. A developer release of v.8 was announced in New York on March 12, 2015. This major enhancement to the product includes a new, separate development language, known as ""LiveCode Builder"",  which is capable of creating new object classes called ""widgets"". In earlier versions, the set of object classes was fixed, and could only be enhanced via the use of ordinary procedural languages like C. The new language, which runs in its own IDE, is a departure from the transitional x-talk paradigm in that it permits typing of variables. But the two environments are fully integrated, and apart from the ability to create new objects, development in LiveCode proceeds in the normal way, within the established IDE. A second crowdfunding campaign to Bring HTML5 to LiveCode reached funding goals of nearly $400,000 USD on July 31, 2014.

BlooP,"BlooP and FlooP are simple programming languages designed by Douglas Hofstadter to illustrate a point in his book Gödel, Escher, Bach. BlooP is a non-Turing-complete programming language whose main control flow structure is a bounded loop (i.e. recursion is not permitted). All programs in the language must terminate, and this language can only express primitive recursive functions. FlooP is identical to BlooP except that it supports unbounded loops; it is a Turing-complete language and can express all computable functions. For example, it can express the Ackermann function, which (not being primitive recursive) cannot be written in BlooP. Borrowing from standard terminology in mathematical logic, Hofstadter calls FlooP's unbounded loops MU-loops. Like all Turing-complete programming languages, FlooP suffers from the halting problem: programs might not terminate, and it is not possible, in general, to decide which programs do. BlooP and FlooP can be regarded as models of computation, and have sometimes been used in teaching computability.",esolang,1979,NA,NA,NA,1031,NA,NA,NA,185,0,Fluid Analogies Research Group

Schema.org,"Schema.org is an initiative launched on 2 June 2011 by Bing, Google and Yahoo! (then operators of the world's largest search engines) to “create and support a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages.” In November 2011 Yandex (whose search engine is the largest one in Russia) joined the initiative. They propose using the schema.org vocabulary along with the Microdata, RDFa, or JSON-LD formats to mark up website content with metadata about itself. Such markup can be recognized by search engine spiders and other parsers, thus gaining access to the meaning of the sites (see Semantic Web). The initiative also describes an extension mechanism for adding additional properties. Public discussion of the initiative largely takes place on the W3C public vocabularies mailing list.

SFC,"Sequential function chart (SFC) is a graphical programming language used for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It is one of the five languages defined by IEC 61131-3 standard.  The SFC standard is defined as, Preparation of function charts for control systems, and was based on GRAFCET (itself based on binary Petri nets). It can be used to program processes that can be split into steps.  Main components of SFC are:  Steps with associated actions; Transitions with associated logic conditions; Directed links between steps and transitions.Steps in an SFC diagram can be active or inactive. Actions are only executed for active steps. A step can be active for one of two motives:  It is an initial step as specified by the programmer. It was activated during a scan cycle and not deactivated since.Steps are activated when all steps above it are active and the connecting transition is superable (i.e. its associated condition is true). When a transition is passed, all steps above are deactivated at once and after all steps below are activated at once. Actions associated with steps can be of several types, the most relevant ones being Continuous (N), Set (S) and Reset (R). Apart from the obvious meaning of Set and Reset, an N action ensures that its target variable is set to 1 as long as the step is active. An SFC rule states that if two steps have an N action on the same target, the variable must never be reset to 0. It is also possible to insert LD (Ladder Diagram) actions inside an SFC program (and this is the standard way, for instance, to work on integer variables). SFC is an inherently parallel language in that multiple control flows — Program Organization Units (POUs) in the standard's parlance — can be active at once. Non-standard extensions to the language include macroactions: i.e. actions inside a program unit that influence the state of another program unit.

basic calculator,"bc, for basic calculator (often referred to as bench calculator), is ""an arbitrary-precision calculator language"" with syntax similar to the C programming language. bc is typically used as either a mathematical scripting language or as an interactive mathematical shell. A typical interactive usage is typing the command bc on a Unix command prompt and entering a mathematical expression, such as (1 + 3) * 2, whereupon 8 will be output. While bc can work with arbitrary precision, it actually defaults to zero digits after the decimal point, so the expression 2/3 yields 0. This can surprise new bc users unaware of this fact. The -l option to bc sets the default scale (digits after the decimal point) to 20 and adds several additional mathematical functions to the language. bc first appeared in Version 6 Unix in 1975 and was written by Robert Morris and Lorinda Cherry of Bell Labs. bc was preceded by dc, an earlier arbitrary-precision calculator written by the same authors. dc could do arbitrary-precision calculations, but its reverse Polish notation (RPN) syntax was inconvenient for users, and therefore bc was written as a front-end to dc. bc was a very simple compiler (a single yacc source file with a few hundred lines), which converted the new, C-like, bc syntax into dc's postfix notation and piped the results through dc. In 1991, POSIX rigorously defined and standardized bc. Two implementations of this standard survive today: The first is the traditional Unix implementation, a front-end to dc, which survives in Unix and Plan 9 systems. The second is the free software GNU bc, first released in 1991 by Philip A. Nelson. The GNU implementation has numerous extensions beyond the POSIX standard and is no longer a front-end to dc (it is a bytecode interpreter).",Programming Language,1975,NA,NA,NA,1054,NA,Yes,NA,440,0,Bell Labs

Teleology figures centrally in Aristotle's biology and in his theory of causes.  It is central to nearly all philosophical theories of history, such as those of Hegel and Marx.  One running debate in modern philosophy of biology is to what extent teleological language (as in the ""purposes"" of various organs or life-processes) is unavoidable, or is simply a shorthand for ideas that can ultimately be spelled out non-teleologically. Philosophy of action also makes essential use of teleological vocabulary: on Davidson's account, an action is just something an agent does with an intention—that is, looking forward to some end to be achieved by the action. In contrast to telos, techne is the rational method involved in producing an object or accomplishing a goal or objective; however, the two methods are not mutually exclusive in principle.",Programming Language,1990,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9beac8bd544384d5c5a34bbd785da04f3692429,1098,NA,NA,NA,960,0,NA

Acorn Atom,"The Acorn Atom is a home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd from 1980 to 1982, when it was replaced by the BBC Micro. The Micro began life as an upgrade to the Atom, originally known as the Proton. The Atom was a progression of the MOS Technology 6502-based machines that the company had been making from 1979. The Atom was a cut-down Acorn System 3 without a disk drive but with an integral keyboard and cassette tape interface, sold in either kit or complete form. In 1980 it was priced between £120 in kit form, £170 ready assembled, to over £200 for the fully expanded version with 12 KB of RAM and the floating point extension ROM. The minimum Atom had 2 KB of RAM and 8 KB of ROM, with the maximum specification machine having 12 KB of each.  An additional floating point ROM was also available.  The 12 KB of RAM was divided between 1 KB for the zero page, 5 KB available for programs, and 6 KB for the high resolution graphics. The zero page was used by the CPU for stack storage, by the OS, and by the Atom BASIC for storage of the 27 variables.  If high resolution graphics were not required then 5½ KB of the upper memory could be used for program storage. It had an MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) video chip, allowing for both text and graphics modes. It could be connected to a TV or modified to output to a video monitor. Basic video memory was 1 KB but could be expanded to 6 KB. Since the MC6847 could only output at 60 Hz, meaning that the video could not be resolved on a large proportion of European TV sets, a 50 Hz PAL colour card was later made available. Six video modes were available, with resolutions from 64×64 in 4 colours, up to 256×192 in monochrome.  At the time, 256×192 was considered to be high resolution. It had built-in BASIC (Atom BASIC), a fast but idiosyncratic version, which included indirection operators (similar to PEEK and POKE) for bytes and words (of 4 bytes each).  Assembly code could be included within a BASIC program, because the BASIC interpreter also contained an assembler for the 6502 assembly language which assembled the inline code during program execution and then executed it. This was a very unusual, but also very useful, function. In late 1982, Acorn released an upgrade ROM chip for the Atom which allowed users to switch between Atom BASIC and the more advanced BASIC used by the BBC Micro. The upgrade was purely to the programming language; the Atom's graphics and sound capabilities remained unchanged, and hence, contrary to some pre-release beliefs, the BBC BASIC ROM did not allow Atom users to run commercial BBC Micro software, since nearly all of it took advantage of the BBC machine's much more advanced graphics and sound hardware. Commercial BBC Micro cassettes could not have been loaded anyway, as they ran at a transfer rate of 1200 baud and the Atom's cassette interface only supported 300 baud. The manual for the Atom was called Atomic Theory and Practice and was written by David Johnson-Davies, subsequently Managing Director of Acornsoft. (The manual used the jargon 'pling' for exclamation mark, a term which may have originated at Acorn, and of which this may have been the first published usage.) The Acorn LAN, Econet, was first configured on the Atom. The case was designed by industrial designer Allen Boothroyd of Cambridge Product Design Ltd.",Programming Language,1980,NA,NA,NA,1129,NA,NA,NA,195,0,Acorn Computers
Sibelius,"Sibelius is a scorewriter program developed and released by Sibelius Software Limited (now part of Avid Technology).  It is the world's largest selling music notation program.  Beyond creating, editing and printing music scores, Sibelius can also play the music back using sampled or synthesised sounds.  It produces printed scores, and can also publish them via the Internet for others to access. Less advanced versions of Sibelius at lower prices have been released, as have various add-ons for the software. Named after the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, the company was founded in April 1993 by twin brothers Ben and Jonathan Finn to market the eponymous music notation program they had created. It went on to develop and distribute various other music software products, particularly for education. In addition to its head office in Cambridge and subsequently London, Sibelius Software opened offices in the US, Australia and Japan, with distributors and dealers in many other countries worldwide.   The company won numerous awards, including the Queen's Award for Innovation in 2005. In August 2006 the company was acquired by Avid, to become part of its Digidesign division, which also manufactures the leading digital audio workstation Pro Tools.  In July 2012, Avid announced plans to divest its consumer businesses, closed the Sibelius London office, and removed the original development team, despite extensive protests on Facebook and elsewhere.

A notable design decision is that the language allows unbounded recursive functions to be used on the type level, making type checking undecidable. Most dependently typed proof assistants and later dependently typed languages such as Agda included a termination checker to prevent the type checker from looping, while the contemporary Dependent ML restricted the expressivity of the type-level language to maintain decidability. There are very few building blocks in the language, but much syntactic sugar to make it more readable. The basic types are functions, products, and sums. Functions and products use dependent types to gain additional power. The syntax is largely borrowed from Haskell. There is no special module system, because with dependent types records (products) are powerful enough to define modules.

OPS5,"OPS5 is a rule-based or production system computer language, notable as the first such language to be used in a successful expert system, the R1/XCON system used to configure VAX computers. The OPS (said to be short for ""Official Production System"") family was developed in the late 1970s by Charles Forgy while at Carnegie Mellon University. Allen Newell's research group in artificial intelligence had been working on production systems for some time, but Forgy's implementation, based on his Rete algorithm, was especially efficient, sufficiently so that it was possible to scale up to larger problems involving hundreds or thousands of rules. OPS5 uses a forward chaining inference engine; programs execute by scanning ""working memory elements"" (which are vaguely object-like, with classes and attributes) looking for matches with the rules in ""production memory"". Rules have actions that may modify or remove the matched element, create new ones, perform side effects such as output, and so forth. Execution continues until no more matches can be found. In this sense, OPS5 is an execution engine for a Petri net extended with inhibitor arcs. The OPS5 forward chaining process makes it extremely parallelizeable during the matching phase, and several automatic parallelizing compilers were created. OPS4 was an early version, while OPS83 came later. The first implementation of OPS5 was written in Lisp, and later rewritten in BLISS for speed. DEC OPS5 is an extended implementation of the OPS5 language definition, developed for use with the VMS, RISC ULTRIX, and DEC OSF/1 operating systems.",Programming Language,1977,NA,NA,NA,1241,NA,NA,NA,150,0,Carnegie Mellon University

Algebraic modeling language,"Algebraic modeling languages (AML) are high-level computer programming languages for describing and solving high complexity problems for large scale mathematical computation (i.e. large scale optimization type problems). One particular advantage of some algebraic modeling languages like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS,MathProg, Mosel,  and OPL is the similarity of their syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of optimization, which is supported by certain language elements like sets, indices, algebraic expressions, powerful sparse index and data handling variables, constraints with arbitrary names. The algebraic formulation of a model does not contain any hints how to process it. An AML does not solve those problems directly; instead, it calls appropriate external algorithms to obtain a solution. These algorithms are called solvers and can handle certain kind of mathematical problems like:  linear problems integer problems (mixed integer) quadratic problems mixed complementarity problems mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints constrained nonlinear systems general nonlinear problems non-linear programs with discontinuous derivatives nonlinear integer problems global optimization problems stochastic optimization problems",Programming Language,1980,NA,NA,NA,1267,NA,NA,NA,120,0,IBM

It was developed as an extension of an earlier language called MUSYS, which was used to control digital and analog devices in an electronic music studio. Mouse was originally intended as a small, efficient language for microcomputers with limited memory.  It is an interpreted, stack-based language and uses Reverse Polish notation.  To make an interpreter as easy as possible to implement, Mouse is designed so that a program is processed as a stream of characters, interpreted one character at a time. The elements of the Mouse language consist of a set of (mostly) one-character symbols, each of which performs a specific function (see table below).  Since variable names are limited to one character, there are only 26 possible variables in Mouse (named A-Z).  Integers and characters are the only available data types. Despite these limits, Mouse includes a number of relatively advanced features, including:  Conditional branching Loops Pointers Macros (subroutines (which may be recursive)) Arrays Code tracingThe design of the Mouse language makes it ideal for teaching the design of a simple interpreter.

GNU Data Language,"The GNU Data Language (GDL) is a free alternative to IDL (Interactive Data Language). Together with its library routines, GDL is developed to serve as a tool for data analysis and visualization in such disciplines as astronomy, geosciences, and medical imaging. GDL is licensed under the GPL. Other open-source numerical data analysis tools similar to GDL include GNU Octave, NCAR Command Language (NCL), Perl Data Language (PDL), R, Scilab, SciPy, and Yorick. GDL as a language is dynamically-typed, vectorized, and has object-oriented programming capabilities. GDL library routines handle numerical calculations (e.g. FFT), data visualisation, signal/image processing, interaction with host OS, and data input/output. GDL supports several data formats, such as NetCDF, HDF (v4 & v5), GRIB, PNG, TIFF, and DICOM. Graphical output is handled by X11, PostScript, SVG, or z-buffer terminals, the last one allowing output graphics (plots) to be saved in raster graphics formats. GDL features integrated debugging facilities, such as breakpoints. GDL has a Python bridge (Python code can be called from GDL; GDL can be compiled as a Python module). GDL uses Eigen (C++ library) numerical library (similar to Intel MKL) to have excellent computing performance on multi-cores processors, with better benchmark than IDL on large matrix operations. Packaged versions of GDL are available for several Linux and BSD flavours as well as Mac OS X. The source code compiles on Microsoft Windows (since GDL 0.9.3) and other UNIX systems, including Solaris. GDL is not an official GNU package.",idl,2004,Marc Schellens,http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/,NA,1290,NA,NA,NA,111,0,https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/issues
NESL,"NESL is a parallel programming language developed at Carnegie Mellon by the SCandAL project and released in 1993. It integrates various ideas from parallel algorithms, and functional programming and array programming languages. The most important new ideas behind NESL are  Nested data parallelism: this feature offers the benefits of data parallelism, concise code that is easy to understand and debug, while being well suited for irregular algorithms, such as algorithms on trees, graphs or sparse matrices. A language based performance model: this gives a formal way to calculate the work and depth of a program. These measures can be related to running time on parallel machines.The main design guideline for NESL was to make parallel programming easy and portable. Algorithms are typically significantly more concise in NESL than in most other parallel programming languages, and the code closely resembles high-level pseudocode. NESL supports nested data parallelism by using the flattening transform to convert nested data parallelism to flat data parallelism. This works by storing nested vectors as the nested data and a segment descriptor of vector lengths, separately. This flattening transform, however, can increase the asymptotic work and space complexity of the original program, leading to a much less efficient result.",Programming Language,1993,NA,NA,NA,1291,NA,Yes,NA,70,0,Carnegie Mellon University

Business Basics added indexed file access methods to the normal set of BASIC commands, and were optimised for other input/output access, especially display terminal control. The two major families of Business Basic are MAI Basic Four and Data General Business Basic.  In addition the Point 4 company, which developed the IRIS operating system, had their own version of BASIC.  The UniBASIC owned by Dynamic Concepts of Irvine is a derivative of the Point 4 BASIC. In the 1980s, Business Basics were ported from their original proprietary environments to many Unix platforms, CP/M, and to DOS. In the 1990s, some Business Basics were ported to Linux and Windows, and Business Basic integrated development environments became available.

Function block diagram,"The Function Block Diagram  (FBD) is a graphical language for programmable logic controller design, that can describe the function between input variables and output variables. A function is described as a set of elementary blocks. Input and output variables are connected to blocks by connection lines. Inputs and outputs of the blocks are wired together with connection lines, or links. Single lines may be used to connect two logical points of the diagram:  An input variable and an input of a block An output of a block and an input of another block An output of a block and an output variableThe connection is oriented, meaning that the line carries associated data from the left end to the right end.  The left and right ends of the connection line must be of the same type. Multiple right connection, also called divergence can be used to broadcast information from its left end to each of its right ends.  All ends of the connection must be of the same type. Function Block Diagram is one of five languages for logic or control configuration supported by standard IEC 61131-3 for a control system such as a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) or a Distributed Control System (DCS).

C shell,"The C shell (csh or the improved version, tcsh) is a Unix shell created by Bill Joy while he was a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley in the late 1970s. It has been widely distributed, beginning with the 2BSD release of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) that Joy began distributing in 1978. Other early contributors to the ideas or the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp. The C shell is a command processor typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands. The C shell can also read commands from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. What differentiated the C shell from others, especially in the 1980s, were its interactive features and overall style. Its new features made it easier and faster to use. The overall style of the language looked more like C and was seen as more readable. On many systems, such as Mac OS X and Red Hat Linux, csh is actually tcsh, an improved version of csh. Often one of the two files is either a hard link or a symbolic link to the other, so that either name refers to the same improved version of the C shell. On Debian and some derivatives (including Ubuntu), there are two different packages: csh and tcsh. The former is based on the original BSD version of csh and the latter is the improved tcsh. tcsh added filename and command completion and command line editing concepts borrowed from the Tenex system, which is the source of the ""t"". Because it only added functionality and did not change what was there, tcsh remained backward compatible with the original C shell. Though it started as a side branch from the original source tree Joy had created, tcsh is now the main branch for ongoing development. tcsh is very stable but new releases continue to appear roughly once a year, consisting mostly of minor bug fixes.",Programming Language,1978,NA,http://mx.gw.com,NA,1301,NA,Yes,#,116,0,"University of California, Berkeley"
Charity,"Charity is an experimental purely functional programming language, developed at the University of Calgary under the supervision of Robin Cockett. Based on ideas by Hagino Tatsuya, it is completely grounded in category theory. Disregarding interactions with the outside world, all Charity programs are guaranteed to terminate or stay productive. The language allows ordinary recursive data types, such as might be found in ML, which are required to be finite, and corecursive data types, which are allowed to be potentially infinite. The control structure for operating on recursive data types is primitive recursion or paramorphism, and the control structure for corecursive data types is primitive co-recursion or apomorphism. Neither control structure can operate over the other kind of data, so all paramorphisms terminate and all apomorphisms are productive.",Programming Language,1992,NA,http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/charity1/www/home.html,NA,1302,ch,Yes,%,111,0,University of Calgary
MIMIC,"MIMIC, known in capitalized form only, is a former simulation computer language developed 1964 by H. E. Petersen, F. J. Sansom and L. M. Warshawsky of Systems Engineering Group within the Air Force Materiel Command at the Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, United States. It is an expression-oriented continuous block simulation language, but capable of incorporating blocks of FORTRAN-like algebra. MIMIC is a further development from MIDAS (Modified Integration Digital Analog Simulator), which represented analog computer design. Written completely in FORTRAN but one routine in COMPASS, and ran on Control Data supercomputers, MIMIC is capable of solving much larger simulation models. With MIMIC, ordinary differential equations describing mathematical models in several scientific disciplines as in engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, economics and as well as in social sciences can easily be solved by numerical integration and the results of the analysis are listed or drawn in diagrams. It also enables the analysis of nonlinear dynamic conditions. The MIMIC software package, written as FORTRAN overlay programs, executes input statements of the mathematical model in six consecutive passes. Simulation programs written in MIMIC are compiled rather than interpreted. The core of the simulation package is a variable step numerical integrator of fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Many useful functions related to electrical circuit elements exist besides some mathematical functions found in most scientific programming languages. There is no need to sort the statements in order of dependencies of the variables, since MIMIC does it internally. Parts of the software organized in overlays are:  MIMIN (input)– reads in user simulation program and data, MIMCO (compiler) – compiles the user program and creates an in-core array of instructions, MIMSO (sort)– sorts the instructions array after dependencies of variables, MIMAS (assembler) – converts the BCD instructions into machine-oriented code, MIMEX (execute)– executes the user program by integrating, MIMOUT (output)– puts out the data as a list or diagram of data.",Programming Language,1964,NA,NA,NA,1303,NA,NA,NA,90,0,Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

HP Time-Shared BASIC,"HP Time-Shared BASIC (HP TSB) is an interpreter software system that was sold by the Hewlett-Packard Company in the late 1960s and 1970s, based on their HP 2100 line of minicomputers. The system implements a dialect of the BASIC programming language and a rudimentary user account and program library system. The system is historically notable as the platform that released the first public versions of the game Star Trek. The software was also known by its versioned name, tied to the hardware version on which it ran, such as HP 2000C Time-Shared BASIC and the operating system came in different varieties — 2000A, 2000B, 2000C, High-Speed 2000C, 2000E, 2000F, and 2000/Access. Except for the 2000A and 2000E systems, the system is implemented using a dual-processor architecture. One fully configured HP 2100-series processor is used for execution of most of the system code and all of the user code, while a second, smaller HP 2100-series processor is used to handle the RS-232 serial lines through which the time-sharing users connected. Depending on the hardware configuration, the system supports up to 16 or up to 32 simultaneous remote users. The usual terminal for a TSB system was a Teletype Model 33 ASR and connected directly to the I/O processor or through a modem or acoustic coupler. Account names are a combination of one alphabetic character, followed by three decimal digits, e.g., B001. Privileged accounts started with the letter ""A"" and had some additional command and program storage capabilities. The superuser account is A000. This scheme allows up to 26,000 user accounts. (In the offshoot system created by BTI Computer Systems accounts beginning with ""@"" were superuser accounts.)During execution, user programs are swapped to fixed-head hard drive (which was physically a disk, but operated like a magnetic drum). When not executing, user programs are stored on moving-head cartridge- or pack-loaded disk storage. Privileged users can also store programs on the much-faster drum. The hard drive was backed up to magnetic tape. Program and file names consist of a mix of up to six alphabetic characters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9). Programs are stored in a tokenized format, using the SAVE command. They can also be stored in a semi-compiled format, using the CSAVE command, which allows them to start quicker. Since the system was closely tied to the use of commonly available teleprinters, line endings in files consisted of the carriage return character (ASCII CR, 0D hexadecimal), followed by the linefeed character (ASCII LF, 0A hexadecimal). The language is a fairly standard implementation of BASIC, providing an integrated editing and runtime environment. Statements are analyzed for correct syntax as they are entered and then stored in tokenized form. Each BASIC statement has to be on a uniquely numbered line, e.g., 10 PRINT ""HELLO WORLD"" and can only contain one statement, although multiple variable assignments are allowed, e.g., 20 LET A=B=C=42 (use of the word ""LET"" was optional). Line numbers are mandatory and statements are automatically placed in ascending numeric sequence. In the earliest version (2000A), the language supported the following features. Later versions added many more features. Unconditional program flow-control via GOTO statements, and subroutines via the GOSUB and RETURN statements Conditional flow-control via IF/THEN statement and simple variable-based block loop FOR and NEXT statements Calculated flow-control via the GOTO/OF and GOSUB/OF statements In-code data storage via DATA, READ, and RESTORE statements Input from and output to the user or a disc file via INPUT, READ #, PRINT, PRINT #, and IF END # statements Numeric variables of the form ""A"" or ""An"" (where A is a single letter and n a single, optional digit) stored as 32-bit floating-point numbers String variables of the form ""A$"" (where A is a single letter), storing from 0 to 72 characters One- or two-dimensional matrix (array) variables of the form ""A[x]"" or ""A[x,y]"" Matrix operations via statements (MAT READ, MAT INPUT, MAT PRINT, MAT=) and operations (+, -, *, ZER, CON, IDN, INV, TRN) Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and relational operators (<, <=, =, #, <>, >=, and >) Built-in mathematical functions including trigonometric (SIN, COS, TAN, ATN), logarithms (LOG, EXP), square root (SQR), random number generator (RND), others (ABS, INT, SGN, MIN, MAX), and user-defined functions Punched tape operations using Teletype Model 33 electromechanical teleprinter remote terminalsSubstrings within strings are accessed using a substring notation: ""A$(L,R)"" or ""A$[L,R]"", where the substring begins with the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the rightmost character specified by the index R, ""A$[L]"" where the substring starts at the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the end of the string. (TSB accepts () or [] interchangeably.) This is in sharp contrast to some later microcomputer BASICs that use functions such as LEFT$(), MID$(), and RIGHT$() to access substrings, although ANSI BASIC continues to use a similar substring syntax to that introduced by Hewlett-Packard. HP's notation can also be used on the destination side of a LET or INPUT statement to modify part of an existing string value, for example 100 A$[3,5]=""XYZ"" or 120 B$[3]=""CHANGE ALL BUT FIRST TWO CHARS"", which cannot be done with early implementations of LEFT/MID/RIGHT$(). Array and substring indices start with 1. Boolean and relational operators can be used in any mathematical expression (giving 0 for false or 1 for true), which was unusual for BASIC languages of that time, but became very popular in languages like C.

Q,"Pure, successor to the equational language Q, is a dynamically typed, functional programming language based on term rewriting. It has facilities for user-defined operator syntax, macros, arbitrary-precision arithmetic (multiple-precision numbers), and compiling to native code through the LLVM. Pure is free and open-source software distributed (mostly) under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later. Pure comes with an interpreter and debugger, provides automatic memory management, has powerful functional and symbolic programming abilities, and interfaces to libraries in C (e.g., for numerics, low-level protocols, and other such tasks). At the same time, Pure is a small language designed from scratch; its interpreter is not large, and the library modules are written in Pure. The syntax of Pure resembles that of Miranda and Haskell, but it is a free-format language and thus uses explicit delimiters (rather than off-side rule indents) to denote program structure. The Pure language is a successor of the equational programming language Q, previously created by the same author, Albert Gräf at the University of Mainz, Germany. Relative to Q, it offers some important new features (such as local functions with lexical scoping, efficient vector and matrix support, and the built-in C interface) and programs run much faster as they are compiled just-in-time to native code on the fly. Pure is mostly aimed at mathematical applications and scientific computing currently, but its interactive interpreter environment, the C interface and the growing set of addon modules make it suitable for a variety of other applications, such as artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, and real-time multimedia processing. Pure plug-ins are available for the Gnumeric spreadsheet and Miller Puckette's Pure Data graphical multimedia software, which make it possible to extend these programs with functions written in the Pure language. Interfaces are also provided as library modules to GNU Octave, OpenCV, OpenGL, the GNU Scientific Library, FAUST, SuperCollider, and liblo (for Open Sound Control (OSC)).",Programming Language,1991,Albert Gräf,https://q-lang.sourceforge.net,NA,1329,NA,NA,NA,61,0,https://sourceforge.net/p/q-lang/_list/tickets

It was devised to allow users to program in commonly performed calculations, such as the Pythagorean theorem and complex trigonometric calculations. Output from the program can be in the form of scrolling or located text, graphs, or by writing data to lists in the calculator memory. Casio also makes label printers which can be used with rolls of paper for the Casio BASIC calculators, and programmes, variables, data, and other items can be exchanged from one calculator to another and to and from a computer via the same kind of cable and audio-type plug used by the TI graphing calculators and/or the same type of cable and mini-USB plug used on HP calculators from the HP48 and many cellular telephones; several models of Casio graphing calculators have both portsThe Casio calculators, as with those of many of the other big three manufacturers' machines, can acquire data from instruments via a data logger to which probes for temperature, light intensity, pH, sound intensity (dBA), voltage and other electrical parameters, as well as other readings, and custom probes to attach to the data logger  can be built and configured for use with the data logger and calculator. Existing instruments can also be modified to interface with the calculator-data logger, in order to collect such data including such things as weather instruments and means of collecting data such as pulse, blood pressure, galvanic skin resistance, EKG and so on. Numerical data can be stored in the lists and matrices available on Casio calculators. This data can be used to create sprites for non-text programs.

Visual Objects,"Visual Objects is an object-oriented computer programming language that is used to create computer programs that operate primarily under Windows. Although it can be used as a general-purpose programming tool, it is almost exclusively used to create database programs. The original Visual Objects project (code-named Aspen) was started as part of Nantucket's attempts to bring the Clipper language to Windows, and move from the procedural to the object-oriented style. It also converted Clipper from a p-code system to being a true native compiler and introduced more elements of the C language (such as typed variables), while including Windows extensions (such as COM, ODBC, and later ADO). With its symbol datatype, it offers the ability to form name-based linkages, which may be used to connect menu events to object methods or form direct linkages between server columns and controls. The Windows version was finally brought to market by Computer Associates.  Unfortunately it was released before it was market-ready and in almost head-to-head competition with the first release of Borland's Delphi product. The language is still in use however the last release by GrafX Software was in 2012 of version 2.8 sp4 (version number 2838). GrafX announced that after this no new versions would be released.

THEOS,"THEOS, which translates from Greek as ""God"", is an operating system which started out as OASIS, a microcomputer operating system for small computers that use the Z80 processor. Originally written in the late 1970s by Timothy S. Williams as a low-cost alternative to the more expensive mini- and mainframe- computers that were popular in the day, OASIS provided time-sharing multiuser facilities to allow several users to utilise the resources of one computer. Similar in concept to MP/M or UNIX, THEOS uses external device drivers rather than a kernel, allowing it to be more portable to other environments, though support has been primarily directed towards industry-standard hardware (i.e. PC's).  THEOS is specifically aimed at small business users, with a wide range of vertical-market applications packages being developed and supported by individuals and companies. THEOS operating systems have been distributed by THEOS Software Corporation in Walnut Creek, California, since 1983. As of 2003, Phase One Systems publishes software development tools for THEOS(R) systems. As well as porting tools, Phase One Systems distributed the Freedom query package and Control database package for THEOS systems, used to bring SQL-like data extraction tools to third-party software packages. The languages distributed with THEOS include THEOS Multi-User Basic and C. A powerful EXEC shell language can be used for task automation or to produce a turnkey system. When the operating system was launched for the IBM Personal Computer/AT in 1982, the decision was taken to change the name from OASIS to THEOS, short for THE Operating System. A number of security features exist, including dynamic passwords (where the password includes part of the date or time, or client IP address, or other dynamic elements), allow/deny security, a comprehensive inbound and outbound firewall, and an option to require a certain level of encryption in the workstation connection. In addition, the object file format is proprietary, and the operating system uses Intel ""protected mode"" to further increase defence against buffer overrun attacks. THEOS was introduced in Europe by Fujitsu and other hardware manufacturers 30 years ago, and is distributed by a number of distributors in Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Italy and more. The 'current' version is THEOS Corona Commercial Release 6, which was released in December 2008, and a number of updates have been released since that time.

Although both JSP and JSF technologies have been improved to work better together, Facelets eliminates the issues noted in Hans Bergsten's article ""Improving JSF by Dumping JSP""Facelets draws on some of the ideas from Apache Tapestry, and is similar enough to draw comparison. The project is conceptually similar to Tapestry's, which treats blocks of HTML elements as framework components backed by Java classes. Facelets also has some similarities to the Apache Tiles framework with respect to support templating as well as composition. Facelets was originally created by Jacob Hookom in 2005 as a separate, alternative view declaration language for JSF 1.1 and JSF 1.2 that both used JSP as the default view declaration language. Starting from JSF 2.0, Facelets has been promoted by the JSF expert group to be the default view declaration language. JSP has been deprecated as a legacy fall back.",template,2005,NA,NA,NA,1374,NA,NA,NA,160,0,https://javaee.github.io
ToonTalk,"ToonTalk is a computer programming system intended to be programmed by children.  The ""Toon"" part stands for cartoon.  The system's presentation is in the form of animated characters, including robots that can be trained by example. It is one of the few successful implementations outside academia of the concurrent constraint logic programming paradigm. It was created by Kenneth M. Kahn in 1995, and implemented as part of the ToonTalk IDE, a software package distributed worldwide between 1996 and 2009. Since 2009, its specification is scholarly published and its implementation is freely available. Beginning 2014 a JavaScript HTML5 version of ToonTalk called ToonTalk Reborn for the Web has been available. It runs on any modern web browser and differs from the desktop version of ToonTalk in a few ways. ToonTalk programs can run on any DOM element and various browser capabilities (audio, video, style sheets, speech input and output, and browser events) are available to ToonTalk programs. Web services such as Google Drive are integrated. ToonTalk Reborn is free and open source. Beyond its life as a commercial product, ToonTalk evolved via significant academic use in various research projects, notably at the London Knowledge Lab and the Institute of Education - projects Playground and WebLabs, which involved research partners from Cambridge (Logotron), Portugal (Cnotinfor and the University of Lisbon), Sweden (Royal Institute of Technology), Slovakia (Comenius University), Bulgaria (Sofia University), Cyprus (University of Cyprus), and Italy (Institute for Educational Technology of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche). It was also source of academic interest in Sweden, where Mikael Kindborg proposed a static representation of ToonTalk programs and in Portugal, where Leonel Morgado studied its potential to enable computer programming by preliterate children.ToonTalk was influenced by the Janus computer programming language and the Actor model.  The main communication abstraction in ToonTalk is the bird/nest pair.  When you (the programmer or a robot) give a thing to a bird, she flies to her nest and puts the thing in it, then returns.  If one or more things already occupy the nest, the bird puts the new one underneath the others. A ToonTalk program is a sequence of rules, where each rule has a head and a tail.  The head is a pattern that can be matched against the argument, which must be a tuple.  In ToonTalk's presentation, a rule appears as a robot, a program as a team of robots, and a tuple as a box that can have any number of holes or compartments in which things may be placed.  The alphabet of things includes number pads, text pads, other boxes, robot teams, birds, nests, and things from some other categories.  A process consists of a box with a team of robots working on it.  If none of the patterns matches the box, the process suspends.  Otherwise, the first rule that matches, fires.  The end of the tail of the rule can either destroy the process, or continue it with the same team.  In case the pattern calls for something other than an empty nest where an empty nest is present, the process suspends until some bird should place something on the nest (usually as a result of the actions of other processes).  A nest with something on it matches the pattern as though the nest were not there, just the (top) something.  The actions in the tail also manipulate the something rather than the whole nest.  Consequently, a nest can be used to program a future. ToonTalk can be given an imperative reading or a declarative reading.  If we ignore certain constructs designed to facilitate I/O, we can see ToonTalk as not having any shared access to mutable memory.  The bird/nest mechanism resembles the communication in the Actor model, but with the additional power to be able to pass nests around and for a process to hold more than one nest (which is also true in Janus).  A difference between communication in the Actor model and in ToonTalk is that ToonTalk preserves the order of the messages; however, ToonTalk can also provide an indeterministic merge of message streams.",Programming Language,1995,Ken Kahn,http://www.toontalk.com/,NA,1375,NA,NA,NA,133,0,NA
TOM object-oriented,"TOM was an object-oriented programming language developed in the 1990s that built on the lessons learned from Objective-C. The main purpose of TOM was to allow for ""unplanned reuse"" of code via a well-developed extension mechanism. This concept was introduced seemingly by accident in Objective-C and later proved to be of wide use, and was applied aggressively in TOM. The primary changes in TOM are the addition of multiple inheritance, tuples as a first-class part of the language, cleaner syntax, free of the C requirements for header files and pre-compiler commands, and the ability to use categories (the re-use mechanism) to include anything. It is this latter ability that represents ""the whole idea"". Unlike Objective-C's categories that allowed only new methods to be built onto existing classes, TOM allowed the addition of class and instance variables, new methods, even new superclasses. This results in the redefinition of ""class"" as ""a class is defined by its main definition and any extensions"", these extensions have become a first-class citizen of the language (similarly to Ruby). The book The Pragmatic Programmer lists TOM as an example for a new language to learn. Development of the TOM language has ceased.",Programming Language,1999,NA,NA,NA,1376,NA,NA,NA,60,0,NA

TRAC,"TRAC (for Text Reckoning And Compiling) Language is a programming language developed between 1959-1964 by Calvin Mooers and implemented on a PDP-10 in 1964 by L. Peter Deutsch. It was one of three ""first languages"" recommended by Ted Nelson in Computer Lib. TRAC T64 was used until 1984, when Mooers updated it to TRAC T84. TRAC is a purely text-based language—a kind of macro language. Unlike traditional ad hoc macro languages of the time, such as those found in assemblers, TRAC is well planned, consistent, and in many senses complete. It has explicit input and output operators, unlike the typical implicit I/O at the outermost macro level, which makes it simultaneously simpler and more versatile than older macro languages. It also differs from traditional macro languages in that TRAC numbers are strings of digits, with integer arithmetic (without specific limits on maximum values) being provided through built-in (""primitive"") functions. Arguably, one aspect of its completeness is that the concept of error is limited to events like lack of file space and requesting expansion of a string longer than the interpreter's working storage; what would in many languages be described as illegal operations are dealt with in TRAC by defining a result (often a null string) for every possible combination of a function's argument strings. The emphasis on strings as strings is so strong that TRAC provides mechanisms for handling the language's own syntactic characters either in their syntactic roles or like any other character, and self-modifying code has more the feel of a natural consequence of typical TRAC programming techniques than of being a special feature. TRAC is, like APL or LISP, an expression oriented language (in contrast to more typical procedure-oriented languages), but unlike APL, it completely lacks operators. In most respects, it is a case of pure functional programming. TRAC has in common with LISP a syntax that generally involves the presence of many levels of nested parentheses. Mooers trademarked the name TRAC in an effort to maintain his control over the definition of the language, an unusual and pioneering action at the time. At one point, he brought an intellectual property infringement suit against DEC, alleging that a contract to deliver a mini-computer with a TRAC interpreter violated his rights. ""The first issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal, one of the early publications in the personal computer field, has a vitriolic editorial against Mooers and his rapacity in trying to charge people for his computing language."" However, the trademark (#72301892) expired in 1992. The name has since been used several times for unrelated information technology projects, including a current open source project management system called Trac. There have been various languages inspired by TRAC. To avoid any trouble with Mooers, they renamed primitives and/or used different metacharacters. In SAM76's case, primitives were added, according to Claude Kagan, ""because TRAC is baby talk"". In MINT's case, primitives were added to give access to a sophisticated text editor machinery. one perceived shortcoming of TRAC was lack of full extensibility: some TRAC primitive functions are sensitive to the distinction between a null (zero-character) argument and a nonexistent (non-delimited) one, but beyond its last non-null argument, a user-defined function cannot make the distinction. SAM76 was a TRAC-like language which eliminated that limitation. Russ Nelson implemented an emacs extension language named MINT (MINT Is Not TRAC). This language is used by the FreeDOS editor FreeMACS. TRAC was used by FTP Software in its PC/TCP product as the modem dialler scripting language. TRAC was also used as a front end on Digital Productions Cray renderer for films, including The Last Starfighter.",Programming Language,1964,Calvin Mooers,NA,NA,1383,NA,NA,NA,85,0,NA

Nice,"Nice is an object-oriented programming language released under the GNU General Public License.

Nice aims to be feature-rich, and as such, in addition to the common features of modern object-oriented programming languages, it implements contracts in the style of Eiffel, class extensibility through multimethods, and many concepts drawn from functional programming such as anonymous functions, tuples, pattern matching (“value dispatch”), and parametric polymorphism. Source programs are compiled to Java bytecode, and can therefore interact with libraries written in Java and other programming languages targeting the Java Virtual Machine.

Coco/R,"Coco/R is a compiler generator that takes an L-attributed Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) grammar of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for that language. The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton.  It supports Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding and can be made case-sensitive or case-insensitive. It can also recognize tokens based on their right-hand-side context. In addition to terminal symbols the scanner can also recognize pragmas, which are tokens that are not part of the syntax but can occur anywhere in the input stream (e.g. compiler directives or end-of-line characters). The parser uses recursive descent; LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by either a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k. Fuzzy parsing is supported by so-called ANY symbols that match complementary sets of tokens. Semantic actions are written in the same language as the generated scanner and parser. The parser's error handling can be tuned by specifying synchronization points and ""weak symbols"" in the grammar. Coco/R checks the grammar for completeness, consistency, non-redundancy as well as for LL(1) conflicts. There are versions of Coco/R for most modern languages (Java, C#, C++, Pascal, Modula-2, Modula-3, Delphi, VB.NET, Python, Ruby and others). The latest versions from the University of Linz are those for C#, Java and C++. For the Java version, there is an Eclipse plug-in and for C#, a Visual Studio plug-in. There are also sample grammars for Java and C#. Coco/R was originally developed at the ETHZ and moved with Hanspeter Mössenböck to University of Linz when he got his appointment there.

Balanced ternary,"Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system (a balanced form), used in some early computers and useful in the solution of balance puzzles. It is a ternary (base 3) number system in which the digits have the values –1, 0, and 1, in contrast to the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, in which digits have values 0, 1 and 2.  Balanced ternary can represent all integers without using a separate minus sign; the value of the leading non-zero digit of a number has the sign of the number itself. While binary numerals with digits 0 and 1 provide the simplest positional numeral system for natural numbers (or for positive integers if using 1 and 2 as the digits), balanced ternary provides the simplest self-contained positional numeral system for integers. Different sources use different glyphs used to represent the three digits in balanced ternary. In this article, T (which resembles a ligature of the minus sign and 1) represents −1, while 0 and 1 represent themselves.

Linden Scripting Language,"Second Life is an online virtual world, developed and owned by the San Francisco-based  firm Linden Lab and launched on June 23, 2003. By 2013, Second Life had approximately one million regular users. In many ways, Second Life is similar to massively multiplayer online role-playing games; however, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: ""There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective"".The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab's own client programs or via alternative third-party viewers. Second Life users, also called residents, create virtual representations of themselves, called avatars, and are able to interact with places, objects and other avatars. They can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in both individual and group activities, build, create, shop, and trade virtual property and services with one another. The platform principally features 3D-based user-generated content. Second Life also has its own virtual currency, the Linden Dollar, which is exchangeable with real world currency.Second Life is intended for people aged 16 and over, with the exception of 13–15-year-old users, who are restricted to the Second Life region of a sponsoring institution (e.g., a school).Built into the software is a 3D modeling tool based on simple geometric shapes that allows residents to build virtual objects. There is also a procedural scripting language, Linden Scripting Language, which can be used to add interactivity to objects.  Sculpted prims (sculpties), mesh, textures for clothing or other objects, animations, and gestures can be created using external software and imported. The Second Life terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create, and the server and client provide simple digital rights management (DRM) functions. However, Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August 2013 to be able to use user-generated content for any purpose. The new terms of service prevent users from using textures from third-party texture services, as some of them pointed out explicitly.",Programming Language,2003,NA,NA,NA,1431,NA,NA,NA,125,0,"Linden Research, Inc"

SYNAPSE,"SyNAPSE is a DARPA program that aims to develop electronic neuromorphic machine technology, an attempt to build a new kind of cognitive computer with form, function, and architecture similar to the mammalian brain.  Such artificial brains would be used in robots whose intelligence would scale with the size of the neural system in terms of total number of neurons and synapses and their connectivity. SyNAPSE is a backronym standing for Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics. The name alludes to synapses, the junctions between biological neurons. The program is being undertaken by HRL Laboratories (HRL), Hewlett-Packard, and IBM Research.  In November 2008, IBM and its collaborators were awarded $4.9 million in funding from DARPA while HRL and its collaborators were awarded $5.9 million in funding from DARPA.  For the next phase of the project, DARPA added $16.1 million more to the IBM effort while HRL received an additional $10.7 million. In 2011, DARPA added $21 million more to the IBM project. and an additional $17.9 million to the HRL project. The SyNAPSE team for IBM is led by Dharmendra Modha, manager of IBM's cognitive computing initiative. The SyNAPSE team for HRL is led by Narayan Srinivasa, manager of HRL's Center for Neural and Emergent Systems.The initial phase of the SyNAPSE program developed nanometer scale electronic synaptic components capable of adapting the connection strength between two neurons in a manner analogous to that seen in biological systems (Hebbian learning), and simulated the utility of these synaptic components in core microcircuits that support the overall system architecture. Continuing efforts will focus on hardware development through the stages of microcircuit development, fabrication process development, single chip system development, and multi-chip system development. In support of these hardware developments, the program seeks to develop increasingly capable architecture and design tools, very large-scale computer simulations of the neuromorphic electronic systems to inform the designers and validate the hardware prior to fabrication, and virtual environments for training and testing the simulated and hardware neuromorphic systems.",Programming Language,1990,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20c4d5f1148f4c058189ae2502a402045aa96069,1436,NA,NA,NA,375,0,NA

MDL,"MDL (the MIT Design Language) is a descendant of the Lisp programming language. Its initial purpose was to provide high level language support for the Dynamic Modeling Group at MIT's Project MAC. It was initially developed in 1971 on the  PDP-10 computer under the Incompatible Timesharing System. The initial development team consisted of Gerald Sussman and Carl Hewitt of the Artificial Intelligence Lab, and Chris Reeve, Bruce Daniels, and David Cressey of the Dynamic Modeling  Group. Later, Stu Galley, also of the Dynamic Modeling Group, wrote the MDL documentation.MDL was initially known as ""Muddle"". This style of self-deprecating humor was not widely understood or appreciated outside of Project MAC and a few other early citadels of information technology.  So the name was sanitized to MDL.MDL provides several enhancements to classical Lisp.  It supports several built-in data types, including lists, strings and arrays, and user-defined data types.  It offers multithreaded expression evaluation and coroutines.  Variables can carry both a local value within a scope, and a global value, for passing data between scopes. Advanced built-in functions supported interactive debugging of MDL programs, incremental development, and reconstruction of source programs from object programs. Although MDL is obsolete, some of its features have been incorporated in later versions of Lisp.  Gerald Sussman went on to develop the Scheme language, in collaboration with Guy Steele, who later wrote the specifications for Common Lisp and Java.  Carl Hewitt had already published the idea for the PLANNER language before the MDL project began, but his subsequent thinking on PLANNER reflected lessons learned from building MDL.  Planner concepts influenced languages such as Prolog and Smalltalk. Smalltalk and Simula, in turn, influenced his future work on the Actor model. But the largest influence that MDL had was on the genre known as interactive fiction.  An interactive fiction game known as Zork, sometimes called Dungeon, was first written in MDL. Later, Reeve, Daniels, Galley and other members of Dynamic Modeling went on to start Infocom, a company that produced many  early commercial works of interactive fiction.",Programming Language,1971,NA,NA,NA,1441,NA,NA,NA,115,0,Massachusetts Institute of Technology

GNU Guix,"GNU Guix () is a cross-platform package manager and a tool to instantiate and manage Unix-like operating systems, based on the Nix package manager with Guile Scheme APIs and specializes in providing exclusively free software. Differing from traditional package managers, Guix (like Nix) utilizes a purely functional deployment model where software is installed into unique directories generated through cryptographic hashes. Dependencies from each software are included within each hash, solving the problem of dependency hell. This approach to package management promises to generate more reliable, reproducible, and portable packages.Guix packages are defined through functional Guile Scheme APIs specifically designed for package management. Dependencies are tracked directly in this language through special values called ""derivations"" which are evaluated by the Guix daemon lazily. Guix keeps track of these references automatically so that installed packages can be garbage collected when no other package depends on them. At the cost of greater storage requirements, all upgrades in Guix are guaranteed to be both atomic and efficiently rolled back. This also enables multiple users to safely install software on the same system without administrator privileges. The extra storage requirements translates to greater bandwidth usage when binary substitutes are downloaded compared to distributions such as Debian. If the user chooses to build everything from source even larger storage space and bandwidth is required.  The development of GNU Guix is intertwined with Guix System (until Guix 1.0: Guix System Distribution [GuixSD]), a complete installable GNU system using the Linux-libre kernel and GNU Shepherd init system.The roll-back feature of Guix is inherited from the design of Nix and is not found in any of the popular Linux distributions such as Debian and its derivatives, Arch Linux and its derivatives, or in other major distributions such as Fedora, CentOS or OpenSUSE. The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers and is incorporated in the French non-profit Guix Europe with members of the community.",distribution,2013,NA,NA,NA,1456,NA,NA,NA,370,0,GNU Project

Semantic Web Rule Language,"The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is a proposed language for the Semantic Web that can be used to express rules as well as logic, combining OWL DL or OWL Lite with a subset of the Rule Markup Language (itself a subset of Datalog).The specification was submitted in May 2004 to the W3C by the National Research Council of Canada, Network Inference (since acquired by webMethods), and Stanford University in association with the Joint US/EU ad hoc Agent Markup Language Committee. The specification was based on an earlier proposal for an OWL rules language.SWRL has the full power of OWL DL, but at the price of decidability and practical implementations. However, decidability can be regained by restricting the form of admissible rules, typically by imposing a suitable safety condition.Rules are of the form of an implication between an antecedent (body) and consequent (head).

It was originally used internally within ICI but was distributed by SPL International in 1974 It was designed for use in real-time computing (hence the initials RTL = real-time language). Based on concepts from Algol 68, it was intended to be a small, simple language. RTL/2 was standardised in 1980 by the British Standards Institution.RTL/2 was a strongly typed language with separate compilation. The compilation units contained one or more items known as ""bricks"", i.e.:  procedure bricks, data bricks, stack bricks.A procedure brick was a procedure, which may or may not return a (scalar) value, have (scalar) parameters, or have local (scalar) variables. The entry mechanism and implementation of local variables was re-entrant. Non-scalar data could only be accessed via reference (so-called REF variables were considered scalar). A data brick was a named static collection of scalars, arrays and records. Programmers had to implement memory management themselves (there was no heap or garbage collection). A stack brick was an area of storage reserved for running all the procedures of a single process and contained the call stack, local variables and other housekeeping items. The extent to which stack bricks were actually used varied depending upon the host environment in which RTL/2 programs actually ran. Access to the host environment of an RTL/2 program was provided via special procedure and data bricks called SVC procedures and SVC data. These were accessible in RTL/2 but implemented in some other language in the host environment.",Programming Language,1972,John Barnes,NA,NA,1474,NA,NA,NA,45,0,NA

Lite-C,"Lite-C is a programming language for multimedia applications and personal computer games, using a syntax subset of the C language with some elements of the C++ language. Its main difference to C is the native implementation of multimedia and computer game related objects like sounds, images, movies, GUI elements, 2D and 3D models, collision detection and rigid body physics. Lite-C executables are compiled instead of interpreted. Lite-C runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows XP or Vista operating systems. Lite-C claims to allow very fast programming with a minimum of code, and easy access to non-programmers.

Gist,"In computing, GiST or Generalized Search Tree, is a data structure and API that can be used to build a variety of disk-based search trees.  GiST is a generalization of the B+ tree, providing a concurrent and recoverable height-balanced search tree infrastructure without making any assumptions about the type of data being stored, or the queries being serviced.  GiST can be used to easily implement a range of well-known indexes, including B+ trees, R-trees, hB-trees, RD-trees, and many others; it also allows for easy development of specialized indexes for new data types. It cannot be used directly to implement non-height-balanced trees such as quad trees or prefix trees (tries), though like prefix trees it does support compression, including lossy compression. GiST can be used for any data type that can be naturally ordered into a hierarchy of supersets. Not only is it extensible in terms of data type support and tree layout, it allows the extension writer to support any query predicates that they choose.  The most widely used GiST implementation is in the PostgreSQL relational database; it was also implemented in the Informix Universal Server, and as a standalone library, libgist. GiST is an example of software extensibility in the context of database systems: it allows the easy evolution of a database system to support new tree-based indexes.  It achieves this by factoring out its core system infrastructure from a narrow API that is sufficient to capture the application-specific aspects of a wide variety of index designs. The GiST infrastructure code manages the layout of the index pages on disk, the algorithms for searching indexes and deleting from indexes, and complex transactional details such as page-level locking for high concurrency and write-ahead logging for crash recovery. This allows authors of new tree-based indexes to focus on implementing the novel features of the new index type — for example, the way in which subsets of the data should be described for search — without becoming experts in database system internals. Although originally designed for answering Boolean selection queries, GiST can also support nearest-neighbor search, and various forms of statistical approximation over large data sets. The PostgreSQL GiST implementation includes support for variable length keys, composite keys, concurrency control and recovery; these features are inherited by all GiST extensions. There are several contributed modules developed using GiST and distributed with PostgreSQL. For example:  rtree_gist, btree_gist - GiST implementation of R-tree and B-tree intarray - index support for one-dimensional array of int4's tsearch2 - a searchable (full text) data type with indexed access ltree - data types, indexed access methods and queries for data organized as a tree-like structures hstore - a storage for (key,value) data cube - data type, representing multidimensional cubesThe PostgreSQL GiST implementation provides the indexing support for the PostGIS (geographic information system) and the BioPostgres bioinformatics system.",Programming Language,1977,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/51e62e71588bce8b05c4b041561304062d656f38,1498,NA,NA,NA,170,0,Information Sciences Institute

The WWB software package is used in conjunction with Microsoft development tools including Visual Studio, Visual Studio.NET, and the ActiveX scripting engines.  The default file extension for programmes written in this language is .wwb   WWB 10 has Windows Scripting Host functionality,  i.e. it contains a scripting engine similar to the default and third-party language implementations for WSH.  This engine is able to access both the .NET framework and the Component Object Model. The current version, 10.01, is available for different combinations of OS and platform. At this time there are four types of WWB, those being WWB.NET for the .NET object model (used with Visual Studio.NET 2005 and 2008 and Vista), .WWB-COM for the COM object model (Visual Studio and Visual Studio.NET earlier versions), both of which are used with all Windows 32 and 64-bit operating systems from Windows 95 to Windows Vista; the other two packages are for Windows CE and PocketPC & Windows Mobile. Earlier versions of WWB ran under Windows 3.1 and ostensibly OS/2 Warp 3 as well. WWB is integrated into many software packages including most categories of PC and server software (e.g. earlier versions of Host Explorer, which now uses two proprietary scripting languages, Hummingbird QuickScript and Hummingbird Basic)   as well as software used to run various types of equipment like mass spectrometers and other lab equipment.",Programming Language,1993,NA,NA,NA,1503,NA,NA,NA,110,0,NA

Caché ObjectScript,"Caché ObjectScript is a part of the Caché database system sold by InterSystems. The language is a functional superset of the ANSI-standard MUMPS programming language. Since Caché is at its core a MUMPS implementation, it can run ANSI MUMPS routines with no change. To appeal as a commercial product, Caché implements support for object-oriented programming, a macro preprocessing language, embedded SQL for ANSI-standard SQL access to M's built-in database, procedure and control blocks using C-like brace syntax, procedure-scoped variables, and relaxed whitespace syntax limitations. The language has private and public variables and globals. Global has a different meaning in this language than in most; such variables are global across routines, processes, and sessions. Thus, editing a global variable is making permanent and immediate changes to a system-universal database (which survives reboots, etc.).  The scope of a private variable is the local function, the scope of a public variable is the entire process. Variables, private and public, may be single elements or complete multi-dimensional arrays. The great majority of Caché's feature-set is inherited from the ANSI MUMPS standard.

Values can be explicitly set and referenced in exactly the same ways as for a global variable, but they can also be set through the associated definition.Interactive A+ development is primarily done in the Xemacs editor, through extensions to the editor. Because A+ code uses the original APL symbols, displaying A+ requires a font with those special characters; a font named kapl is provided on the web site for that purpose.

Euclid,"Euclid is an imperative programming language for writing verifiable programs. It was designed by Butler Lampson and associates at the Xerox PARC lab in the mid-1970s. The implementation was led by Ric Holt at the University of Toronto and James Cordy was the principal programmer for the first implementation of the compiler. It was originally designed for the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. It was considered innovative for the time; the compiler development team had a $2 million budget over 2 years and was commissioned by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Canadian Department of National Defence. It was used for a few years at I. P. Sharp Associates, MITRE Corporation, SRI International and various other international institutes for research in systems programming and secure software systems. Euclid is descended from the Pascal programming language. Functions in Euclid are closed scopes, may not have side effects, and must explicitly declare imports. Euclid also disallows gotos, floating point numbers, global assignments, nested functions and aliases, and none of the actual parameters to a function can refer to the same thing. Euclid implements modules as types.

FL is a dynamically typed strict functional programming language with throw and catch exception semantics much like in ML. Each function has an implicit history argument which is used for doing things like strictly functional input/output (I/O), but is also used for linking to C code. For doing optimization, there exists a type-system which is an extension of Hindley–Milner type inference. Many of the language’s innovative ideas have since been implemented in Kenneth E.

Edinburgh IMP,"Edinburgh IMP is a development of ATLAS Autocode, initially developed around 1966-1969 at Edinburgh University, Scotland.  IMP was a general-purpose programming language which was used heavily for systems programming. Expressively, IMP is extremely similar to Algol and includes all the Algol-style block structure, reserved keywords, and datatypes such as arrays and records.  It adds to Algol-style languages a string type (akin to a flex array of char) and built-in operators for string manipulation and character handling. IMP provides significant control over the storage mapping of data, plus commands for addressing within parts of words.  Most IMP compilers offer compiler-generated run-time checks and a backtrace facility by default, even in production code. IMP allows the programmer to inline machine language instructions in the IMP source code. Early IMP compilers were developed for the English Electric KDF9,  ICL System 4, UNIVAC 1108, IBM 360, DEC PDP-9, DEC PDP-15 and CTL Modular One computers. IMP was used to implement the EMAS operating system.  In later years a version of IMP called IMP77 was developed by Peter Robertson within the Computer Science department at Edinburgh which was a portable compiler that brought IMP to even more platforms.  In 2002 the IMP77 language was resurrected by the Edinburgh Computer History Project for Intel x86 hardware running DOS, Windows and Linux and is once again in use by Edinburgh graduates and ex-pats. The diverged IMP and IMP77 were later consolidated into a single language with the introduction of the IMP80 standard supported by implementations from the Edinburgh Regional Computer Centre.  IMP80 has also been ported to several platforms including Intel and was actively in use into the 1990s. Edinburgh IMP is unrelated to the later IMP extensible syntax programming language developed by Irons for the CDC 6600, which was the main language used by the NSA for many years.",Programming Language,2002,NA,NA,NA,1562,NA,NA,NA,65,0,University of Edinburgh

TAL,"Transaction Application Language or TAL (originally ""Tandem Application Language"") is a block-structured, procedural language optimized for use on Tandem hardware. TAL resembles a cross between C and Pascal. It was the original system programming language for the Tandem CISC machines, which had no assembler. The design concept of TAL, an evolution of Hewlett Packard's SPL, was intimately associated and optimized with a microprogrammed CISC instruction set. Each TAL statement could easily compile into a sequence of instructions that manipulated data on a transient floating register stack. The register stack itself floated at the crest of the program's memory allocation and call stack. The language itself has the appearance of ALGOL or Pascal, with BEGIN and END statements. However, its semantics are far more like C. It does not permit indefinite levels of procedure nesting, it does not pass complex structured arguments by value, and it does not strictly type most variable references. Programming techniques are much like C using pointers to structures, occasional overlays, deliberate string handling and casts when appropriate. Available datatypes include 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit and (introduced later) 64 bit integers. Microcode level support was available for null terminated character strings. However, this is not commonly used. Originally the Tandem NonStop operating system was written in TAL. Recently much of it has been rewritten in C and TAL has been deprecated for new development. In the migration from CISC to RISC TAL was updated/replaced with pTAL - compilers allowed TAL to be accelerated/re-compiled into Native RISC Applications. In the current migration from RISC to Intel Itanium 2 TAL and pTAL has been replaced with epTAL, again - compilers allow TAL and pTAL code to be accelerated/re-compiled into native Itanium Applications.  This article is based on material taken from  the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing  prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the ""relicensing"" terms of the GFDL, version 1.3 or later.",Programming Language,2008,NA,NA,NA,1583,NA,Yes,NA,105,0,NA
ASIC,"ASIC is a programming language, a BASIC dialect and shareware compiler for DOS systems.  Written by Dave Visti of 80/20 Software, it achieved brief popularity in the 1990s as one of the few BASIC compilers legally available for download from BBSes.  However, ASIC understood only a small subset of the BASIC language, with most versions having little or no support for logical operators, control structures, and floating-point arithmetic.  These shortcomings are the reason for the software's tongue-in-cheek motto, ""ASIC: It's almost BASIC!""Notably, however, ASIC did feature a rudimentary integrated development environment and an RS-232 communications library for writing terminal and BBS software, as well not requiring line numbers.  The last release of ASIC, version 5.00, was more compatible with GW-BASIC and offered a utility to convert GW-BASIC programs to ASIC syntax. ASIC allows compiling to a DOS EXE file or COM file. The low overhead of the COM file format lets ASIC make one of the smallest compiled executables of the Hello world program, typically 360 bytes.",Programming Language,1992,NA,NA,NA,1584,NA,NA,NA,100,0,80/20 Software

SAC,"SAC (Single Assignment C) is a strict purely functional programming language whose design is focused on the needs of numerical applications. Emphasis is laid on efficient support for array processing. Efficiency concerns are essentially twofold. On the one hand, efficiency in program development is to be improved by the opportunity to specify array operations on a high level of abstraction. On the other hand, efficiency in program execution, i.e. the runtime performance of programs, in time and memory consumption, is still to be achieved by sophisticated compilation schemes. Only as far as the latter succeeds, the high-level style of specifications can actually be called useful. To facilitate compiling to efficiently executable code, certain functional language features which are not considered essential for numerical applications, e.g. higher-order functions, polymorphism, or lazy evaluation, are not (yet) supported by SAC. These may be found in general-purpose functional languages, e.g. Haskell, Clean, Miranda, or ML. To overcome the acceptance problems encountered by other functional or array based languages intended for numerical / array intensive applications, e.g. SISAL, NESL, Nial, APL, J, or K, particular regard is paid to ease the transition from a C / Fortran like programming environment to SAC. In more detail, the basic language design goals of SAC are to:  provide a purely functional language with a syntax very similar to that of C in order to ease, for a large community of programmers, the transition from an imperative to a functional programming style; support multi-dimensional arrays as first class objects; allow the specification of shape- and dimension-invariant array operations; provide high-level array operations that liberate programming from tedious and error-prone specifications of starts, stops and strides for array traversals thereby improving code reusability and programming productivity, in general. incorporate a module system that allows for separate compilation, separate name spaces, and abstract data types, and, additionally, provides an interface to foreign languages in order to enable reuse of existing code; provide means for a smooth integration of states and state modifications into the functional paradigm based on uniqueness types; use the module system, the foreign language interface, and the integration of states in order to create a standard library which provides a functionality similar to that of the standard C libraries, e.g. powerful I/O facilities or mathematical functions; facilitate the compilation to host machine code which can be efficiently executed both in terms of time and space demand; facilitate the compilation for non-sequential program execution in multiprocessor environments.",Programming Language,1994,Sven-Bodo Scholz and Clemens Grelck,NA,NA,1590,NA,NA,NA,75,0,NA

SequenceL,"SequenceL is a general purpose functional programming language and auto-parallelizing (Parallel computing) compiler and tool set, whose primary design objectives are performance on multi-core processor hardware, ease of programming, platform portability/optimization, and code clarity and readability.  Its main advantage is that it can be used to write straightforward code that automatically takes full advantage of all the processing power available, without programmers needing to be concerned with identifying parallelisms, specifying vectorization, avoiding race conditions, and other challenges of manual directive-based programming approaches such as OpenMP. Programs written in SequenceL can be compiled to multithreaded code that runs in parallel, with no explicit indications from a programmer of how or what to parallelize. As of  2015, versions of the SequenceL compiler generate parallel code in C++ and OpenCL, which allows it to work with most popular programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, and Python.  A platform-specific runtime manages the threads safely, automatically providing parallel performance according to the number of cores available, currently supporting x86, OpenPOWER/POWER8, and ARM platforms.",Programming Language,1989,NA,NA,NA,1606,NA,NA,NA,130,0,NA

De Bruijn index,"In mathematical logic, the de Bruijn index is a tool invented by the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn for representing terms of lambda calculus without naming the bound variables. Terms written using these indices are invariant with respect to α-conversion, so the check for α-equivalence is the same as that for syntactic equality. Each de Bruijn index is a natural number that represents an occurrence of a variable in a λ-term, and denotes the number of binders that are in scope between that occurrence and its corresponding binder. The following are some examples:  The term λx. λy. x, sometimes called the K combinator, is written as λ λ 2 with De Bruijn indices. The binder for the occurrence x is the second λ in scope. The term λx. λy. λz. x z (y z) (the S combinator), with de Bruijn indices, is λ λ λ 3 1 (2 1). The term λz. (λy. y (λx. x)) (λx. z x) is λ (λ 1 (λ 1)) (λ 2 1). See the following illustration, where the binders are coloured and the references are shown with arrows. De Bruijn indices are commonly used in higher-order reasoning systems such as automated theorem provers and logic programming systems.",notation,1972,Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn,NA,http://alexandria.tue.nl/repository/freearticles/597619.pdf,1612,NA,NA,NA,250,0,Technical University Eindhoven

GEORGE,"GEORGE is a programming language invented by Charles Leonard Hamblin in 1957.It was designed around a push-down pop-up stack for arithmetic operations, and employed reverse Polish notation. The language included loops, subroutines, conditionals, vectors, and matrices. Algebraic expressions were written in reverse Polish notation; thus,                         a         +         b                 {\displaystyle a+b}    was written a b +, and similarly for the other arithmetic operations of subtraction, multiplication, and division. The algebraic expression                         a                    x                        2                             +         b         x         +         c                 {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}    was written a x dup × × b x × + c +, where 'dup' meant 'duplicate the value'. Following the reverse Polish form, an assignment statement to evaluate the formula                         y         =         a                    x                        2                             +         b         x         +         c                 {\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+bx+c}    was written as a x dup × × b x × + c + (y). The computer evaluated the expression as follows: the values of a, then x, were pushed onto the top of the accumulator stack; 'dup' caused a copy of the top-most value (x) to be pushed onto the top of the accumulator stack; Multiply (×) caused the top two values, namely, x and x, to be removed (popped) and multiplied, returning the product to the top of the accumulator stack.  The second multiply (×) then caused the top two values on the stack (namely, a and x**2) to be popped and multiplied, and the product (a×x**2) to be pushed onto the top of the accumulator stack.  And so on the remaining components of the expression.  The final operation, namely (y), returned the value of the expression to storage without changing the status of the accumulator stack. Assuming that the value on the top of the accumulator stack was not required immediately, it would be removed (cleared) by using the operator (;). The following program reads in eight values and forms their sum:  0, 1, 8 rep (j)    R + ] (P)  The first line initialises the sum by pushing the value zero onto the top of the accumulator stack. The second line introduces a loop, is spoken as ""for 1 to 8 repeat for j"", and is terminated by the square bracket. In the third line, R causes one number to be read in and pushed onto the top of the accumulator stack, and the plus sign (+) causes that value to be added to the (partial) sum, leaving only the partial sum on the top of the accumulator stack. After the loop terminates, the (P) causes the final sum to be punched on a card.Manipulation of vectors and matrices requires subscript notation.  In GEORGE, the subscript(s) preceded the vector or matrix name.  Thus A(j) was written j | A. The following program reads in vector a of 10 values, then forms the squares of those values, and finally prints those values.  1, 10 R1 (a) 1, 10 rep (j)    j | a dup * j | (a) ; ] 1, 10 P1 (a)  In the program, the first line is a vector read that reads in the ten values into a(1) through a(10). The second line introduces a loop to run through the ten values of j. The third line fetches a(j), duplicates it, multiplies those two values giving the square, and then stores it in  a(j).  Note the semicolon (;), which clears (or cancels) the top entry in the accumulator stack.  Were this not done, the accumulator would gradually fill up with the squares of the values. The final line is a vector punch (i.e., print) to write out the ten squares.The above GEORGE coding table assisted in transcribing a program onto punch cards. Conditional operations were written as jumps, as follows: if a > 0 go to 5 (which transfers to label 5 if a is greater than zero) would be written  0 a > 5 ↑  Label 5 was indicated by including *5 elsewhere in the program. Unconditional transfers were written 5↑ Subroutine calls were made with the down arrow, .g., to call subroutine labelled 17, write 17↓, where the label 17 was encoded using column 3 of the above table.",Programming Language,1957,NA,NA,NA,1614,NA,NA,NA,55,0,University of New South Wales

Atari Microsoft BASIC,"The Atari Microsoft BASIC and Atari Microsoft BASIC II variants of the BASIC programming language were ROM cartridge or floppy disk packaged versions of the Microsoft BASIC dialect ported to the Atari 8-bit machines. Atari originally licensed Microsoft BASIC for use in their 8-bit computers, but were unable to fit it in an 8 KB ROM cartridge, the largest cartridge size available at the time. They outsourced to another company, Shepardson Microsystems Inc. (SMI), who had similar problems fitting the language onto an 8k cartridge. SMI proposed creating an entirely new version of BASIC for the new platforms, and built Atari BASIC instead. Atari Microsoft BASIC, unlike Atari BASIC, didn't allow abbreviations for keywords; keywords had to be fully spelled out. Syntax checking occurred after running a program, not immediately after entering the line. Also, arithmetic operations with integers resulted in an integer result.  Atari Microsoft BASIC came in two packages:  Floppy disk – CX8126 ROM cartridge – RX8035. Since the cartridge could only hold 16 KB, the remaining 11 KB file was included on an ""extension"" disk. The cartridge version was called Atari Microsoft BASIC II.Although more feature filled than Atari BASIC, Microsoft BASIC never had the popularity that Atari BASIC had. The biggest problems were:  increased memory needed (at least 32 KB) disk drive required performance (faster than Atari BASIC, but slower than Turbo-Basic XL and BASIC XL) not compatible with Atari BASIC added costThe cartridge version eliminated the first two requirements, but a disk drive was needed for all of its features.",Programming Language,1981,NA,NA,NA,1622,NA,NA,NA,70,0,Microsoft

PL/C eliminated some of the more complex features of PL/I, and added extensive debugging and error recovery facilities. PL/C is a subset of PL/I.   A program that runs without error under the PL/C compiler should run under PL/I and produce the  same results, unless certain incompatible diagnostic features, such as a  macro section (begun by a $MACRO statement and finished by a $MEND statement), were used.The PL/C compiler had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements.",Programming Language,1973,NA,NA,NA,1624,NA,NA,NA,70,0,Cornell University

Similar to traditional code, ACS is compiled using ACC (an homage to C's gcc utility) for use in Doom, Hexen, etc... Scripts can be executed in a variety of methods, such as being attached to in-game actors, execution through level triggers around each map, or invocation from other scripts or functions.

DAP FORTRAN,"DAP FORTRAN was an extension of the non IO parts of FORTRAN with constructs that supported parallel computing for the ICL Distributed Array Processor (DAP). The DAP had a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture with 64x64 single bit processors. DAP FORTRAN had the following major features:  It had matrix and vector operations. Assignments could be performed under a logical mask so only some elements in the target of an assignment were changed. On the negative side - operations were performed using the size of the underlying hardware i.e. on a 64x64 matrix or 64 element vector.In a declaration either one or two extents could be omitted as in:  The omitted dimension was taken as 64, the size of one side of the DAP. The speed of arithmetic operations depended strongly on the number of bits in the value. INTEGER*n reserved 8n bits where n is 1 to 8, and REAL*n reserved 8n bits where n is 3 to 8. LOGICAL reserved a single bit. However, DAP FORTRAN fell between two conflicting objectives. It needed to effectively exploit the DAP facilities. But also had to be accessible to the scientific computing community whose primary language, with a design closely tied to serial architectures, was FORTRAN. The dialect used was ICL's 2900-series FORTRAN which was based on an early version of the FORTRAN 77 standard and had mismatches with both FORTRAN 77 and the older FORTRAN 66 standard. DAP FORTRAN was significantly different from either standard FORTRAN and the machine was not capable of accepting or optimising standard FORTRAN programs. On the other hand, compared with other contemporary languages which were by design extensible (notably ALGOL-68), FORTRAN was less than well suited to this task. The result was noticeably inelegant and did require a great deal of new learning. Operationally, there was an overhead to transfer computational data into and out of the array, and problems which did not fit the 64x64 matrix imposed additional complexity to handle the boundaries (65x65 was perhaps the worst case!) – but for problems which suited the architecture, it could outperform the current Cray pipeline architectures by two orders of magnitude. A later version of the DAP used Fortran-Plus instead which was based on FORTRAN 77 and had more flexible indexing. In particular it automatically mapped user sized arrays onto the underlying hardware.",Programming Language,1975,NA,NA,NA,1632,NA,NA,NA,30,0,International Computers Limited

The ABC 80 was based on an earlier modular computer system from the same company and built around a Z80 and 16 KB of ROM containing a fast semi-compiling BASIC interpreter. It had 16-32 KB of RAM as main memory and a dedicated (included) tape recorder for program and data storage, but could also be expanded to handle disk drives as well as many other peripherals.  The ROM could be extended in increments of 1 or 4KB in order to handle such so called ""options"". The monitor was a black and white TV set modified for the purpose, an obvious choice since Luxor also made TVs. The ABC 80 was used in schools and officies around Scandinavia and parts of Europe. It was also used for industrial automation, scientific measurement and control systems. Like its successor, the ABC 800, the computer had an unusually quick and usable BASIC with excellent I/O response times, something that was often discovered when trying to switch to IBM PC-based personal computers. Due to its roots in an industrial computer system, the ABC 80 also had a flexible bus extension system with many (external) expansion and peripheral cards available for various purposes and applications, as well as high quality support and documentation.

XPL0,"XPL0 is a computer programming language that is essentially a cross between Pascal and C. It was created in 1976 by Peter J. R. Boyle who wanted a high-level language for his microcomputer and wanted something more sophisticated than BASIC, which was the dominant language for personal computers at the time. XPL0 is based on PL/0, an example compiler in the book Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs by Niklaus Wirth. The first XPL0 compiler was written in ALGOL. It generated instructions for a pseudo-machine that was implemented as an interpreter on a Digital Group computer based on the 6502 microprocessor. The compiler was converted from ALGOL to XPL0 and was then able to compile itself and run on a microcomputer. XPL0 soon proved its worth in a variety of products based on the 6502. These embedded systems would otherwise have had their code written in assembly language, which is much more tedious to do. Boyle used XPL0 to write a disk operating system called Apex. Beginning in 1980 this was sold, along with XPL0, as an alternative to Apple DOS for the Apple II computer, which was based on the 6502. Since those early years XPL0 has migrated to other processors and many features have been added.

Schematron,"Schematron is a rule-based validation language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML trees.  It is a structural schema language expressed in XML using a small number of elements and XPath. In a typical implementation, the Schematron schema XML is processed into normal XSLT code for deployment anywhere that XSLT can be used. Schematron is capable of expressing constraints in ways that other XML schema languages like XML Schema and DTD cannot. For example, it can require that the content of an element be controlled by one of its siblings. Or it can request or require that the root element, regardless of what element that is, must have specific attributes. Schematron can also specify required relationships between multiple XML files. Constraints and content rules may be associated with ""plain-English"" validation error messages, allowing translation of numeric Schematron error codes into meaningful user error messages. The current ISO recommendation is Information technology, Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL), Part 3: Rule-based validation, Schematron (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2016).",xmlFormat,1999,NA,NA,NA,1669,NA,NA,NA,220,0,NA

The language shares Metafont's declarative syntax for manipulating lines, curves, points and geometric transformations. However,  Metafont is set up to produce fonts, in the form of image files (in .gf format) with associated font metric files (in .tfm format), whereas MetaPost produces EPS, SVG, or PNG files The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster-based format, whereas MetaPost's output is vector-based graphics (lines, Bézier curves) Metafont output is monochrome, whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors. The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams, either strings from a specified font, or anything else that can be typeset with TeX. Starting with version 1.8, Metapost allows floating-point arithmetic with 64 bits (default: 32 bit fixed-point arithmetic)Many of the limitations of MetaPost derive from features of Metafont. For instance, MetaPost does not support all features of PostScript.

Interactive C Interpreter,"ICI is a general purpose interpreted, computer programming language originally developed by Tim Long in the late 1980s. It has dynamic typing and flexible data types, with the basic syntax, flow control constructs and operators of C. It can be considered broadly similar to Perl, with which it is roughly contemporary. Like Perl, it also has tight integration with regular expressions. ICI is not an acronym.Primitive data types in ICI include integers, reals, strings, files, safe pointers, and regular expressions. Aggregate data types are arrays, sets, and associative tables. Sets can be heterogeneous, nested, and support the usual set operations: union, intersection, etc. The language supports subroutines and nested modules. All variables are lexically scoped at the subroutine or module level, but unlike most structured languages, ICI allows the current scope to be adjusted (Tcl also allows this, for example). ICI is not object-based, many object programming features can be emulated in the language by using a data structure inheritance feature called super-structures. To support application development, ICI has C-like file I/O and system interface support, as well as a high-level event trigger facility. The language also has a modest standard library of built-in functions. It is also notable for its generous license, which permits use for any purpose, including commercial and alteration and resale.",Programming Language,1980,NA,http://atrn.org/ici/,NA,1708,NA,NA,NA,46,0,Canon Information Systems Research

MetaComCo,"MetaComCo (MCC) was a computer systems software company started in 1981 and based in Bristol, England by Peter Mackeonis and Derek Budge. A division of Tenchstar, Ltd. MetaComCo's first product was an MBASIC compatible interpreter for IBM PCs, which was licensed by Peter Mackeonis to Digital Research in 1982, and issued as the Digital Research Personal Basic, or PBASIC, running under CP/M. Other computer languages followed, also licensed by Digital Research and MetaComCo established an office in Pacific Grove, California, to service their United States customers. In 1984 Dr. Tim King joined the company, bringing with him a version of the operating system TRIPOS for the Motorola 68000 processor which he had previously worked on whilst a researcher at the University of Cambridge. This operating system was used as the basis of AmigaDOS (file-related functions of AmigaOS); MetaComCo won the contract from Commodore because the original planned Amiga disk operating system called Commodore Amiga Operating System (CAOS) was behind schedule; timescales were incredibly tight and TRIPOS provided a head start for a replacement system. MetaComCo also developed ABasiC for the Amiga which was initially provided with Amigas. Much to Commodore's annoyance MetaComCo also worked with Atari to produce the BASIC that was initially provided with the Atari ST — ST BASIC. The company also sold the Lattice C compiler for the Sinclair QL and the Atari ST and range of other languages  (e.g. Pascal, BCPL) for m68k-based computers. MetaComCo also represented LISP and REDUCE software from the RAND Corporation. Several of the team at MetaComCo went on to found Perihelion Software. Mackeonis founded Triangle Publishing, the software publishing company responsible for creating the ST Organizer for the Atari ST and PC Organizer and Counterpoint (a GUI system) for Amstrad Computers and GoldStar computers.",Programming Language,1981,NA,NA,NA,1721,NA,NA,NA,50,0,MetaComCo

Game Oriented Assembly Lisp,"Game Oriented Assembly Lisp (or GOAL) is a video game programming language developed by Andy Gavin and the Jak and Daxter team at Naughty Dog. It was written using Allegro Common Lisp and used in the development of the entire Jak and Daxter series of games. Syntactically GOAL resembles Scheme, though with many idiosyncratic features such as classes, inheritance, and virtual functions. GOAL encourages an imperative programming style: programs tend to consist of a sequence of events to be executed rather than the functional programming style of functions to be evaluated recursively. This is a diversion from Scheme, which allows such side-effects but does not encourage imperative style. GOAL does not run in an interpreter, but instead is compiled directly into PlayStation 2 machine code for execution. It offers limited facilities for garbage collection, relying extensively on runtime support. It offers dynamic memory allocation primitives designed to make it well-suited to running in constant memory on a video game console. GOAL has extensive support for inlined assembly code using a special rlet form, allowing programmers to freely mix assembly and higher-level constructs within the same function. The GOAL compiler is implemented in Allegro Common Lisp. It supports a long term compiling listener session which gives the compiler knowledge about the state of the compiled and therefore running program, including the symbol table. This, in addition to dynamic linking, allows a function to be edited, recompiled, uploaded, and inserted into a running game without having to restart. The process is similar to the ""edit and continue"" feature offered by some C++ compilers, but allows the programmer to replace arbitrary amounts of code (even up to entire object files), and does not interrupt the running game with the debugger. This feature was used to implement code as well as level streaming in the Jak and Daxter games. GOAL's first use was for the Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy game. The predecessor language, Game Oriented Object Lisp (GOOL), was also developed by Andy Gavin for the Crash Bandicoot game. Since Naughty Dog no longer employs GOAL's primary development and maintenance engineer and they were under pressure from their new parent company (Sony) to share technology between studios, Naughty Dog transitioned away from Lisp. However, they have since resumed using it for scripting on some PlayStation 3 games, including The Last of Us.",Programming Language,1993,Andy Gavin,NA,NA,1755,NA,NA,NA,195,0,"Naughty Dog, LLC"
SP/k,"SP/k is a programming language developed circa 1974 by R.C. Holt, D.B. Wortman, D.T. Barnard and J.R. Cordy as a subset of the PL/I programming language designed for teaching programming. It was used for about a decade at over 40 universities, schools, and research laboratories in Canada and the United States. SP/k was one of the first languages specifically designed to encourage structured programming. The features of SP/k were chosen to encourage structured problem solving by computers, to make the language easy to learn and use, to eliminate confusing and redundant constructs, and to make the language easy to compile.The resulting language was suitable for introducing programming concepts used in various applications, including business data processing, scientific calculations and non-numeric computation.  SP/k is actually a sequence of language subsets called SP/1, SP/2, … SP/8. Each subset introduces new programming language constructs while retaining all the constructs of preceding subsets, forming a stepwise system for teaching computer programming. Each subset is precisely defined and self-contained, and can be learned or implemented without the following subsets. This allows for various levels of programming education. The design and philosophy of SP/k was a strong influence on the Turing programming language.",Programming Language,1974,Ric Holt and D.B. Wortman and D.T.

Obliq,"Obliq is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language designed to make distributed, and locally multi-threaded, computation simple and easy for the programmer, while providing program safety and implicit type system. The interpreter is written in Modula-3, and provides Obliq with full access to Modula-3's network objects capabilities. A type inference algorithm for record concatenation, subtyping and recursive types has been developed for Obliq, more important it has been proved to be NP-complete  and its lowest complexity to be Ο(n3) or if under other modeling up to certain conditions down to Ο(n2)  and its best known implementation runs in Ο(n5). Obliq's syntax is very similar to Modula-3, the biggest difference being that Obliq has no need of explicit typed variables (i.e., a variable can hold any data type allowed by the type checker and if does not accepts one, i.e., a given expression execution error will be thrown) although explicit type declarations are allowed and ignored by the interpreter. The basic data types in the language include booleans, integers, reals, characters, strings, and arrays. Obliq supports the usual set of sequential control structures (conditional, iteration, and exception handling forms), as well as special control forms for concurrency (mutexes and guarded statements). Besides that Obliq's objects are able to be cloned and safely copied remotely by any machine in a distributed network object and it can be done in a transparent way. Obliq's large standard library provides strong support for mathematical operations, I/O, persistence, thread control, graphics, and animation. Distributed computation is object-based: objects hold a state, which is local to a particular process. Scope of objects and other variables is purely lexical. Objects can call methods of other objects, even if those objects are on another machine on the network. Obliq objects are simply collections of named fields (similar to slots in Self and Smalltalk), and support inheritance by delegation (like Self). The common uses of Obliq involve programming over networks, 3D animation, and distributed computation over Ethernet LAN as. Obliq is included free with the DEC Modula-3 distribution, but other free versions exist elsewhere including pre-compiled binaries for several operating systems.",Programming Language,1993,NA,NA,NA,1758,NA,NA,NA,65,0,DEC

Knowledge Interchange Format,"Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a computer language designed to enable systems to share and re-use information from knowledge-based systems. KIF is similar to frame languages such as KL-One and LOOM but unlike such language its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers of KIF likened it to PostScript. PostScript was not designed primarily as a language to store and manipulate documents but rather as an interchange format for systems and devices to share documents. In the same way KIF is meant to facilitate sharing of knowledge across different systems that use different languages, formalisms, platforms, etc. KIF has a declarative semantics. It is meant to describe facts about the world rather than processes or procedures. Knowledge can be described as objects, functions, relations, and rules. It is a formal language, i.e., it can express arbitrary statements in first order logic and can support reasoners that can prove the consistency of a set of KIF statements. KIF also supports non-monotonic reasoning. KIF was  created by Michael Genesereth, Richard Fikes and others participating in the DARPA knowledge Sharing Effort.Although the original KIF group intended to submit to a formal standards body, that did not occur.  A later version called Common Logic has since been developed for submission to ISO and has been approved and published.

Content Assembly Mechanism,"Content Assembly Mechanism (CAM) is an XML-based standard for creating and managing information exchanges that are interoperable and deterministic descriptions of machine-processable information content flows into and out of XML structures. CAM is a product of the OASIS Content Assembly Technical Committee. The CAM approach aligns with the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) approach and assists with producing Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD). The camprocessor tools enable creation of realistic XML examples from XSD schema structure definitions. These XML samples simulate test cases for use in interoperability testing and determination of templates for use in actual business information exchanges. The single most important problem that CAM is solving is simpler and more reliable interoperability for business information exchanges. Today's electronic commerce via the internet is extremely limited in the amount of automation or integration that is occurring. The ability to share accurate concise and verifiable information exchange definitions is a critical next step in enabling easier and cheaper global commerce. CAM is emerging as the definitive standard underlying effective management of information exchanges through the critical mass being generated by the open source solution.A broad range of OASIS standard definitions are now being documented, validated and enhanced using the CAM open source toolset and approach. To date these include EDXL, CIQ, and EML. CAM use is also extending to external industry groups such as PESC, MISMO, STAR Automotive, CAQH and then for government uses including stratML, LEXS and NIEM. Each group faces the same challenges in promoting localizations of their overall standards in ways that can be quickly verified and adopted. Using CAM they are able to take their existing XSD schema work and rapidly develop localization templates, XML test cases, new subset schemas for use with web services and create re-usable want lists and content hints. In addition CAM templates are used to build domain dictionaries directly from the XSD schema definitions and then produce cross-reference spreadsheets for individual templates to the master dictionary definitions. All these capabilities are aimed at improving the quality and speed of implementation and interoperability using business information exchanges based on XML.",xmlFormat,2002,NA,NA,NA,1765,NA,NA,NA,185,0,OASIS Content Assembly Technical Committee

Portable Standard Lisp,"Portable Standard Lisp (PSL) is a tail-recursive dynamically bound dialect of Lisp inspired by its predecessor, Standard Lisp and the Portable Lisp Compiler. It was developed by researchers at the University of Utah in 1980, which released PSL 3.1; development was handed over to developers at Hewlett-Packard in 1982 who released PSL 3.3 and up. Portable Standard Lisp was available as a kit containing a screen editor, a compiler, and an interpreter for the 68000 processor architecture, DEC-20s, CRAY-1s, and the VAX architecture (among many others). Today, PSL is mainly developed by and available from Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin.  Its main modern use is as underlying language for implementations of Reduce.Like most older lisps, PSL in the first step compiles Lisp to LAP code, which is a platform independent language in its own.  However, where older lisps mostly compiled LAP directly to assembler or some architecture dependent intermediate,  PSL compiles the LAP to C code, which would run in a virtual machine language; so programs written in it in principle are as portable as C itself, which is very portable. The compiler itself was written in PSL or a more primitive dialect dubbed ""System Lisp""/""SYSLISP"" as ""an experiment in writing a production-quality Lisp in Lisp itself as much as possible, with only minor amounts of code written by hand in assembly language or other systems languages"", so the whole ensemble could bootstrap itself, and improvements to the compiler improved the compiler itself as well.

Rebeca Modeling Language,"Rebeca (acronym for Reactive Objects Language) is an actor-based modeling language with a formal foundation, designed in an effort to bridge the gap between formal verification approaches and real applications. It can be considered as a reference model for concurrent computation, based on an operational interpretation of the actor model. It is also a platform for developing object-based concurrent systems in practice. Besides having an appropriate and efficient way for modeling concurrent and distributed systems, one needs a formal verification approach to ensure their correctness. Rebeca is supported by a set of verification tools. Earlier tools provided a front-end to work with Rebeca code, and to translate the Rebeca code into input languages of well-known and mature model checkers (like SPIN and NuSMV) and thus, were able to verify their properties. Rebeca, since 2005, is supported by a direct model checker based on Modere (the Model checking Engine of Rebeca). Modular verification and abstraction techniques are used to reduce the state space and make it possible to verify complicated reactive systems. Besides these techniques, Modere supports partial order reduction and symmetry reduction.",Programming Language,2004,Marjan Sirjani,https://rebeca-lang.org,https://rebeca-lang.org/assets/theses/Mapping-UML-Diagrams-to-the-Reactive-Object-Language-(Rebeca).pdf#glo%3Arebeca,1782,NA,NA,NA,51,0,Sharif University of Technology

Tree and Tabular Combined Notation,"TTCN is a programming language used for testing of communication protocols and web services. A TTCN test suite consists of many test cases written in the TTCN programming language. Until version 2 the language was written in tables and called Tree and Tabular Combined Notation. Reading and editing this language required special TTCN editors. Beginning with version 3 TTCN was renamed to Testing and Test Control Notation. It is now closer to current programming languages and can be edited with traditional editors. TTCN-3 is more flexible than TTCN-2 in that it can be used for protocol testing as well as testing traditional software. All versions of TTCN need dedicated compilers or interpreters for execution. TTCN is widely used, for example; ETSI, ITU for the testing of telecommunication protocols. Conformance test cases of ETSI standards like ISDN, DECT, GSM, EDGE, 3G, DSRC have also been written in TTCN. Recently it has also been used for testing various protocol standards e.g. Bluetooth, IP. Execution of those test cases against products (e.g. phones, mobile phones, service enablers or network elements) is used to verify that the protocol implementation in those products meet the requirements defined by telecommunication standards.

ColorForth,"colorForth is a programming language from the Forth language's original designer, Charles H. Moore, developed in the 1990s. There was an earlier predecessor called 386 OK which appeared for sale at Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group (SVFIG) meetings in 1992.An idiosyncratic programming environment, the colors simplify Forth's semantics, speed compiling, and are said to aid Moore's own poor eyesight: colorForth uses different colors in its source code (replacing some of the punctuation in standard Forth) to determine how different words are treated. colorForth was originally developed as the scripting language for Moore's own homebrew VLSI CAD program OKAD, with which he develops custom Forth processors. As the language gained utility, he rewrote his CAD program in it, spruced up the environment, and released it to the public. It has since gained a small following, spurred much debate in the Forth community, and sprung offshoots for other processors and operating environments. The language's roots are closer to the Forth machine languages Moore develops for his processors than to the mainstream standardized Forths in more widespread use. The language comes with its own tiny (63K) operating system. Practically everything is stored as source code and compiled as and when needed. The current colorForth environment is limited to running on Pentium grade PCs with limited support for lowest-common-denominator motherboards, AGP video, disk, and network hardware. Coloring in colorForth has semantic meaning. Red words start a definition and green words are compiled into the current definition. Thus, colorForth would be rendered in standard Forth as:   : color forth ;  Moore developed Forth in the early 1970s and created a series of implementations of the language. In the 1980s he diverged from (or rather ignored) the standardization of the language, instead continuing to evolve it. He developed a series of Forth-like languages, each fairly extreme in its simplicity: Machine Forth, OK, colorForth. There is some controversy about colorForth marginalizing color blind programmers, but Moore has stated that color is only one option for displaying the language. One of Moore's papers on colorForth was printed in black and white, but used italics and other typographical conventions to present source code.",Programming Language,1992,Charles H.

CodeGear Delphi,"Delphi is an integrated development environment (IDE) for rapid application development of desktop, mobile, web, and console software, developed by Embarcadero Technologies. It is also an event-driven language.  Delphi's compilers use their own Object Pascal dialect of Pascal and generate native code for Microsoft Windows, macOS (IA-32 only), iOS, Android and Linux (x64 only). Since 2016, there have been new releases of Delphi every six months, with new platforms being added approximately every second release.Delphi includes a code editor, a visual designer, an integrated debugger, a source code control component, and support for third-party plugins. The code editor features Code Insight (code completion), Error Insight (real-time error-checking), and refactoring. The visual forms designer has traditionally used Visual Component Library (VCL) for native Windows development, but the FireMonkey (FMX) platform was later added for cross-platform development. Database support in Delphi is very strong. A Delphi project of a million lines to compile in a few seconds – one benchmark gave 170,000 lines per second. Delphi was originally developed by Borland as a rapid application development tool for Windows as the successor of Turbo Pascal. Delphi added full object-oriented programming to the existing language, and since then the language has grown to support generics and anonymous methods, and native Component Object Model (COM) support. In 2006, Borland’s developer tools section was transferred from Borland to a wholly owned subsidiary known as CodeGear, which was sold to Embarcadero Technologies in 2008. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by Idera Software, but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division. Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, are interoperable. They share many core components, notably the IDE, VCL, and much of the runtime library. In addition, they can be used jointly in a project. For example, C++Builder 6 and later can consume Delphi source code and C++ in one project, while packages compiled with C++Builder can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as RAD Studio, a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, which can be purchased with either or both.",Programming Language,1995,NA,NA,NA,1807,NA,NA,NA,55,0,Borland Software Corporation && Embarcadero Technologies

ZBasic,"ZBasic is a compiler which was first released by Simutek (Tucson, Arizona) in 1980.  The combined efforts of Andrew Gariepy, Scott Terry, David Overton, Greg Branche, and Halbert Laing led to versions for MS-DOS,  Apple II, Macintosh, CP/M, and TRS-80 computers. ZBasic is a very fast, efficient and quite advanced BASIC compiler with an integrated development environment. It aims to be used as a cross-platform development system, where the same source code can be compiled to different platforms without any modifications. ZBasic features device independent graphics: the same compiled code can work on different display resolutions and colors, and even in text mode. Original PC versions include graphical support up to EGA for MS-DOS. A special feature of ZBasic is BCD (binary coded decimal) math with accuracy up to 54 digits. Another special feature is INDEX$ array, an array of variable length strings that could be easily sorted, searched etc. In 1991, Harry Gish and 32 Bit Software Inc. of Dallas, Texas purchased the MS-DOS version. Nando Favaro expanded it to include 16- and 32-bit-specific machine code as well as VGA and VESA video.

UIML,"UIML (User Interface Markup Language) is an XML-based user interface markup language for defining user interfaces on computers. Basically UIML tries to reduce the work needed to develop user interfaces. It allows you to describe the user interface in declarative terms (i.e. as text) and abstract it. Abstracting means that you don't exactly specify how the user interface is going to look, but rather what elements are to be shown, and how should they behave. For example, to describe a message window, you could write:  In theory then you could use that description to generate user interfaces for different platforms, like PDAs. In practice, the different capabilities of those different platforms make a complete translation difficult. Other less ambitious domain-specific programming languages attempt only to describe the user interfaces (or other parts of the application or process) in a domain (for example Windows). See for example the Microsoft language XAML. These languages do a better job usually, but are less flexible.

Mallard BASIC,"Mallard BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for CP/M written by Locomotive Software and supplied with the Amstrad PCW range of small business computers, the ZX Spectrum +3 version of CP/M Plus, and the Acorn BBC Micro Z80 second Processor. In the 1980s, it was standard industry practice to bundle a BASIC interpreter with microcomputers, and the PCW followed this practice.  While it was primarily a wordprocessor for business use, it was not a dedicated WP: it also ran the CP/M operating system. Though there were existing implementations of BASIC for CP/M, such as Digital Research's CBASIC and the third-party ZBasic, they followed the earlier 1970s model of compilers, fed source code prepared in a separate text editor. Mallard was more like a traditional micro ROM BASIC, with an integrated editor which was tailored for the PCW's non-standard 90-column screen. Although the PCW actually had excellent monochrome graphics support for its time and specification, closely comparable to the Hercules Graphics Card for the PC, Mallard BASIC had no graphics support whatsoever. Instead, Locomotive optimised it for business use, with, for instance, full ISAM random-access file support, making it easier to write database applications. It was also optimised for speed –  it is named after the LNER A4 class 4468 Mallard locomotive, the fastest steam locomotive in the world, once again displaying the company's fondness for railway-oriented nomenclature. (For instance, see the company name itself.) In fact the Locomotive name came from the phrase ""To run like a train"" and it was this theme that was used to name Mallard BASIC –  no other Locomotive product was named after anything railway-oriented. The Acorn version was designed simply to run the Compact Software small business accounting products Acorn was including to target its Z80 second processor at small businesses. Mallard's major innovation designed specifically for Acorn was the addition of the Jetsam B*-tree keyed access filing system to give similar (but superior) features to the Miksam product Compact had originally designed around. Graphics could be implemented by loading the GSX extension to CP/M, but this was cumbersome for BASIC programmers. The lack of graphics support was rectified by several BASIC toolkits, of which the most popular was LEB: Lightning Extended BASIC. This patched Mallard BASIC, replacing the redundant LET keyword with LEB, which could be followed by a wide variety of parameters to allow sophisticated graphics (for the time) to be drawn on screen, saved to disc, printed, et cetera. Probably the most widespread Mallard application ever was RPED, the text editor supplied with the PCW. The name was short for Roland Perry's EDitor, the program being put together quickly by Roland Perry, the Amstrad executive running the computer product development, when it was realised that CP/M-80 came with no usable full-screen editor, but users had a requirement to edit configuration files. The same problem was apparent with DOS Plus and MS-DOS supplied with IBM-compatible Amstrad computers, but the RPED for those machines was written in 8086 assembler, and not Mallard BASIC. The PC version of Mallard Basic is still available from LocoScript Software as an MS-DOS program which will run under Windows as a Disc only version with licence or with the full Introduction & Reference manual.",Programming Language,1985,NA,NA,NA,1830,NA,NA,NA,60,0,Locomotive Software

Early Lisps had many limitations, including limited data types and slow numerics. Its use of fully parenthesized notation was also considered a problem. The inventor of Lisp, John McCarthy, expected these issues to be addressed in a later version, called notionally Lisp 2. Hence the name Lisp 1.5 for the successor to the earliest Lisp.Lisp 2 was a joint project of the System Development Corporation and Information International, Inc., and was intended for  the IBM built AN/FSQ-32 military computer.

The registers of the CPU were available in NPL as predefined variables.

CECIL,"Cecil is a pure object-oriented programming language that was developed by Craig Chambers at the University of Washington in 1992 to be part of the Vortex project there. Cecil has many similarities to other object-oriented languages, most notably Objective-C, Modula-3, and Self. The main goals of the project were extensibility, orthogonality, efficiency, and ease-of-use. The language supports multiple dispatch and multimethods, dynamic inheritance, and optional static type checking. Unlike most other OOP systems, Cecil allows subtyping and code inheritance to be used separately, allowing run-time or external extension of object classes or instances. Like Objective-C, all object services in Cecil are invoked by message passing, and the language supports run-time class identification. These features allow Cecil to support dynamic, exploratory programming styles. Parameterized types and methods (generics, polymorphism), garbage collection, and delegation are also supported. Cecil also supports a module mechanism for isolating independent libraries or packages. Cecil does not presently support threads or any other form of concurrency. A standard library for Cecil is also available and includes various collection, utility, system, I/O, and GUI classes.

Meditech Interpretive Information System,"MIIS (Meditech Interpretive Information System) is a MUMPS-like programming language that was created by A.Neil Pappalardo and Curt W. Marble, on a DEC PDP at Mass General Hospital from 1964 to 1968. MUMPS evolution took two major directions: MUMPS proper and MIIS. MUMPS became an ANSI and ISO-standard language. When many MUMPS implementations standardized to be compatible, MIIS did not standardize, but became a proprietary system instead. As an example of the differences between MUMPS and MIIS, the value of a logical expression in MUMPS may be false = zero (0) or true = non-zero, canonically, one (1). In MIIS, the value false is the empty string and the value of true is a string consisting of the ASCII delete character (code 127 decimal). There is also a philosophical difference between the dialects.  MIIS often takes the approach that code should march along, regardless of possible errors, where MUMPS will error out to prevent more serious problems.  For example, when encountering an undefined variable, MUMPS generates an error where MIIS treats it as nil. In the 1980s Brigham and Women's Hospital in Massachusetts used MIIS to program their Data General Mainframe. In 1986, SCAMC reported that Vancouver General Hospital also had an Integrated Cardiology Patient Management System written in MIIS. The MIIS language has been used in programming library systems as well as health industry systems. The OCLC's library system is one example.

It is designed by Steven Ericsson-Zenith, a researcher at Yale University, the Institute for Advanced Science & Engineering in Silicon Valley, California, the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, and the Pierre and Marie Curie University, the science department of the Sorbonne.The book Process Interaction Models is the Ease language specification. Ease combines the process constructs of communicating sequential processes (CSP) with logically shared data structures called contexts. Contexts are parallel data types that are constructed by processes and provide a way for processes to interact. The language includes two process constructors. A cooperation includes an explicit barrier synchronization and is written:                         ∥         P         (         )         ∥         Q         (         )         ;                 {\displaystyle \parallel P()\parallel Q();}   If one process finishes before the other, then it will wait until the other processes are finished. A subordination creates a process that shares the contexts that are in scope when created and finishes when complete (it does not wait for other processes) and is written:                                                 /                                                          /                  P         (         )         ;                 {\displaystyle {\big /}\!\!/P();}   Subordinate processes stop if they attempt to interact with a context that  has completed because the parent process has stopped. This enables speculative processes to be created that will finish if their result is not needed. Powerful replication syntax allows multiple processes to be created. For example,                         ∥                    i                                      f           o           r                                      n                  :         P         (         i         )         ;                 {\displaystyle \parallel {i}\;{for}\;{n}:P(i);}   creates n synchronized processes each with a local constant i. Processes cannot share local variables and cooperate in the construction of shared contexts. Certain context types, called resources, ensure call-reply semantics. There are four functions upon contexts:  read (context, variable) – copies a value from the shared context to the variable. write (context, expression) – copies the value of expression to the shared context. put (context, name) – moves the value bound to name to the shared context. The value of name is subsequently undefined. get (context, name) – moves a value from context and binds it to name. The value is removed from the context.Context types are Singletons, Bags or Streams and can be subscripted arrays. Ease has a semiotic definition. This means that it accounts for the effect the language has on the programmer and how they develop algorithms. The language was designed to ease the developing of parallel programs.",Programming Language,1991,Steven Ericsson-Zenith,NA,NA,1876,NA,NA,NA,65,0,Yale University && École des Mines de Paris - Université PSL && Pierre && Marie Curie University && The Sorbonne

IPTSCRAE,"Iptscrae is a stack-oriented scripting language used to give additional functionality to The Palace software and servers. Its name comes from the pronunciation of ""script"" in Pig Latin. [1] The language was created by Jim Bumgardner, who in turn was inspired by Forth, another stack-based language.  Bumgardner chose this style of language because it is extremely easily to implement an interpreter, since there is no need to support parenthetical groupings or operator precedence. The name ""iptScrae"" was borrowed by Bumgardner from a former colleague and mentor, Kevin Bjorke, who came up with the name ""iptscray"" for a freeware Forth interpreter a few years previously.  Bumgardner originally created Iptscrae for Idaho, an in-house multi-media authoring system, similar to HyperCard, which he created while an employee at Warner New Media.  He then reused and modified the IptScrae compiler for the Palace project, which was developed in 1994. Although it is a scripting language, many have used it to provide additional functionality to many other programs and functions. Forums can be created with Iptscrae while embedding it with JavaScript, as many factions of Iptscrae fans have done in the past. It's fully possible to implement Iptscrae with other languages, even if they're not on the same dynamic principles. For example, Iptscrae has, in the past, been webbed together with Java, JavaScript, HTML, and other artificial languages, including other scripting languages, programming languages, specification languages, query languages, and markup languages to add more end-user interactions and commands to other programs, without sacrificing user-friendliness. In the past years, Iptscrae has even been utilized in computer peer groups through open-source language compilers, using not only transformation and hardware description languages, but also combining it with several other genres of computer languages to create an intertwined web of user-friendliness and application compatibility.",Programming Language,1994,NA,NA,NA,1879,NA,NA,NA,35,0,Warner New Media

The emphasis in that early generation of compilers was minimization of the memory footprint, because memory was a very expensive resource at the time.

Data General Business Basic,"Data General Business Basic was a BASIC interpreter (based on MAI Basic Four's version) developed by Data General for their Nova minicomputer in the 1970s, and later ported to the Data General Eclipse MV and AViiON computers. Most business applications for the Nova were developed in Business Basic. Business Basic was an integer-only language inspired by COBOL, and contained powerful string-handling functions and the ability to manipulate indexed files very quickly. It also provided full control over the display screen, with cursor positioning, attribute setting, and region-blanking commands. Business Basic could interface to Data General's INFOS II database, and make calls directly to the operating system. A lock server gave multiple concurrent users efficient access to database records. Small business programs could be developed and debugged rapidly with Business Basic because of the interactive nature of the interpreter, but the language did not provide many structured programming features, and as programs grew larger, maintenance became a problem. There was limited memory space for Business Basic programs on the Nova, and programmers often resorted to tricks such as self-modifying programs, which was easy to program in Business Basic, but complicated to debug. The original version of the language was ""double precision"", i.e. 32-bit (and so each integer used two 16-bit Nova words). When Data General ported the language to the MV line, they included two copies of the language, one ""double precision"", and one ""triple precision"". Unfortunately the two were incompatible with each other in subtle ways. Although Data General improved the language in some ways, such as adding multiple-line IF THEN ELSE END IF statements, they failed to lift many of the constraints of the language on the MV machines, such as a 9,999 line maximum, 384 variable limit, and maximum of 16 open files.",Programming Language,1970,NA,NA,NA,1890,NA,NA,NA,45,0,Data General Corporation
UPIC,"UPIC (Unité Polyagogique Informatique CEMAMu) is a computerised musical composition tool, devised by the composer Iannis Xenakis. It was developed at the Centre d'Etudes de Mathématique et Automatique Musicales (CEMAMu) in Paris, and was completed in 1977. Xenakis used it on his subsequent piece Mycènes Alpha (1978), and it has been used by composers such as Jean-Claude Risset (on Saxatile (1992)), François-Bernard Mâche (Hypérion (1981), Nocturne (1981), Tithon (1989), Moires (1994), Canopée (2003)), Takehito Shimazu (Illusions in Desolate Fields (1994)),  Mari King, and Curtis Roads. Aphex Twin talked about it in an interview Physically, the UPIC is a digitising tablet linked to a computer, which has a vector display. Its functionality is similar to that of the later Fairlight CMI, in that the user draws waveforms and volume envelopes on the tablet, which are rendered by the computer. Once the waveforms have been stored, the user can compose with them by drawing ""compositions"" on the tablet, with the X-axis representing time, and the Y-axis representing pitch. The compositions can be stretched in duration from a few seconds to an hour. They can also be transposed, reversed, inverted, and subject to a number of algorithmic transformations. The system allows for real time performance by moving the stylus across the tablet. The UPIC system has subsequently been expanded to allow for digitally sampled waveforms as source material, rather than purely synthesised tones. In 2005, Mode Records of New York released a 2-CD compilation of works composed with the UPIC, entitled Xenakis, UPIC, Continuum, which provides an overview of the machine's sonic possibilities. There were a couple of attempts to reproduce the UPIC system using commodity hardware, for instance Iannix, HighC, UPISketch. IanniX, which has been sponsored by the French Ministry of Culture, is a graphical open-source sequencer which syncs via Open Sound Control events and curves to a real-time environment (like Pure Data, SuperCollider, Csound, MaxMSP and openFrameworks among others). For its part, HighC is currently used as a pedagogical tool in classes ranging from early teens to Master classes in composition, while some contemporary composers, such as George Hatzimichelakis have made it part of their toolset.

WFL,"Work Flow Language, or WFL (""wiffle"") is the process control language for the Burroughs large systems, including the Unisys ClearPath/MCP series, and their operating system Master Control Program. Developed soon after the B5000 in 1961, WFL is the ClearPath equivalent of the Job Control Language (JCL) on IBM mainframes and the shell scripts of Unix-like operating systems.

WFL programs are compiled to binary executables like any other MCP subject. WFL  is used for high-level system operations, such as running tasks, moving and copying files, providing high-level recoverability. Thus it is not a general purpose language in that you would not use it to do general computations. You can open and close files to check their attributes for example; however, you cannot read or change their contents in WFL – that you do in a general purpose language, and invoke it as a task from WFL. WFL has a high-level ALGOL-like readable syntax. It has none of the low-level assembler-like commands of JCL like //SYSIN DD, etc. in order to connect hardware devices and open files for programs. All WFL constructs deal with the high-level abstractions of tasks and files. Parameters are also real HLL parameters, not the $1, $2... style position parameters of shell scripts. WFL also has an instruction block command which is used to give operators instructions needed to run the current job. These instructions are displayed using the 'IB' operator command. WFL was a compiled language on the medium systems.  Because some OS interfaces may change from release to release, Medium Systems WFL code included a copy of the source in the object file. Upon executing a WFL job it would check to determine if the object was compatible with the OS version.  If not it would trigger a recompile of the object using the source embedded in the object code.",Programming Language,1961,NA,NA,NA,1925,NA,NA,NA,70,0,NA

BCX,"BCX is a free software programming development application originally created in 1999 by Kevin Diggins.  BCX converts BASIC source code to C/C++ source code which can then be compiled using any one of a number of available Microsoft Win32 C/C++ compilers. For many years, most implementations of BASIC shared a nagging drawback - the programs that users created performed slower than similar programs that were created using C/C++.  BCX changed that by giving users the friendliness and ease of use of the BASIC language and coupled it with the high performance and flexibility of C/C++. BCX is written in the BCX BASIC language, making BCX a self-translating translator. BCX was made an open source project in 2004. Since then, several members of the BCX community have led the continued development and maintenance of BCX. Recent project forks have resulted in variants of BCX that can produce native-code applications that run on Linux and Apple operating systems. BCX contains verbs that simplify the creation of Windows UI desktop applications. Unlike many BASIC implementations that rely on run-time engines, the combination of BCX and most C/C++ compilers produce efficient and performant native code applications. BCX can be used to create GUI, DLL, console mode, and web server applications. BCX can use the Standard C Library.",Programming Language,1999,Kevin Diggins and Robert Wishlaw,NA,NA,1927,NA,NA,NA,70,0,NA
Cornell University Programming Language,"Cornell University Programming Language (also called CUPL) is a procedural computer programming language developed at Cornell University in the late 1960s. CUPL was based on an earlier Cornell-developed programming language, CORC.  It was used to teach introductory computer programming classes. CUPL was developed by R. W. Conway, W. L. Maxwell, G. Blomgren, Howard Elder, H. Morgan, C. Pottle, W. Riddle, and Robert Walker.  CUPL had a very simple syntax similar to BASIC and to PL/I. The processor was designed to offer extensive error correction and diagnostic capabilities.  This would allow student programs to execute even if they contained minor syntax errors.  The compiler also included spelling correction capabilities so that if a variable name is referenced only once, the compiler would assume that it was a misspelling of some other intended name. CUPL also offered an extensive set of matrix operations and offered dynamic run-time memory allocation.  At the time, Cornell's computer was an IBM System 360 Model 40 with only 64K of core memory.  CUPL was able to process a large batch of student programs quickly by remaining resident in core memory, but the compiler occupied 58K of memory, leaving only a small amount for the program code and variable storage.",Programming Language,1967,NA,NA,NA,1928,NA,NA,NA,70,0,Cornell University

Lava,"Lava is an experimental, visual object-oriented, interpreter-based programming language with an associated programming environment (Lava Programming Environment or LavaPE) that uses structure editors instead of text editors. Only comments, constants, and new identifiers may be entered as text. Declarations are represented in LavaPE as tree structures whose subtrees may be collapsed or expanded. The properties of the declared Lava entities can be edited through pop-up dialogs. Although executable code has a traditional text representation in LavaPE, it can be edited only as complete syntactic units, rather than character by character. If you insert a new syntactic construct, it will typically contain ""placeholders"" (syntactic variables) that can then be replaced by concrete constructs; the latter may in turn contain syntactic variables, etc. LavaPE provides a tool button for every type of syntactic construct, and a button is enabled only if it is syntactically correct to insert the associated construct at the selected place. Further characteristic properties of Lava and LavaPE include the following:  It provides strict syntactic separation of interface (public) and implementation (private) sections of a Lava class. It distinguishes variable ""state objects"" from constant ""value objects""; the latter cannot be modified any longer after creation/initialization. It supports ""virtual types"": type parameters of classes and packages (families of related classes). As a consequence, undermining of strong type checks by ""type casts"" is no longer required. It uses recursion and logical quantifiers instead of traditional loop constructs. It uses single assignment; i.e., a value can be assigned to a variable only once within the same branch of a function. It supports refactoring extensively via the LavaPE structure editors. It distinguishes between constituents (sub-objects) and object acquaintances (pointers to independent objects). Copying and deletion of complex objects is largely facilitated in this way. Since release 0.9.0, LavaPE completely prevents inadvertent access to uninitialized variables and null objects already at programming time by complete static initialization checks.Lava is open source software using the GPL license (see also Lava at the Free Software Foundation and at KDE-Apps.org). It currently runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X platforms.",Programming Language,2001,NA,NA,NA,1934,NA,NA,NA,125,0,Institute for Secure Telecooperation

Piet,"An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke.  The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software. Usually, an esolang's creators do not intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax,  have inspired practical applications in the arts.  Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists. Usability is rarely a goal for esoteric programming language designers—often it is quite the opposite.  Their usual aim is to remove or replace conventional language features while still maintaining a language that is Turing-complete, or even one for which the computational class is unknown.",esolang,1990,NA,NA,NA,1936,NA,NA,NA,125,0,https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html
B32 Business Basic,"B32 Business Basic was a competitor to Data General Business Basic written by Murray Haszard in 1986. It ran on the Data General Eclipse MV line of computers initially, and was ported to Unix in 1989 and to DOS in 1991. B32 Software was the company that developed and supported B32 Business Basic, with the original site in Auckland, New Zealand supplemented by a sales and support centre in Blue Ash, Ohio. The B32 interpreter was highly compatible with Data General Business Basic (DGBB), but it also enhanced and extended that language in many ways. Like DGBB, B32 could access Data General's INFOS II database and it could use DGBB's lock server or its own improved version. B32 was over twice as fast for number crunching, string manipulation, and disk I/O. Many of the internal restrictions of DGBB were removed. B32 allowed 32,767 line numbers (65,535 in later versions), compared with DGBB's 9,999. B32 allowed more memory for programs, more simultaneous locks, and more files to be open at once. Language enhancements included a high-speed internal sort routine, do-while blocks, and the ability to step backwards through an indexed file. Debugging facilities were also significantly improved over DGBB. B32 allowed programs to run with full cursor positioning and attribute support on non-Data General terminals, even programs which had Data General control sequences hard-coded into them. B32 carried out all arithmetic at ""quad precision"", i.e. 64-bit, and emulated the ""triple precision"" and ""double precision"" versions of DGBB at runtime. This avoided the subtle incompatibilities between the two versions of DGBB. On Unix and DOS, B32 emulated all commonly used system calls of Data General's AOS/VS and RDOS operating systems, including implementing its own symbolic links on SCO Xenix and DOS. In 1991, a features war between B32 and one of its competitors, Transoft's Universal Business Basic, saw major improvements to the B32 language. B32 added a Bluebird Business Basic emulation mode, made line numbers optional, and added subroutine calls by name with parameter passing. Transoft had greater financial resources than B32, and more effective marketing. It purchased B32 in 1992. The DOS and Unix versions of B32 were discarded as Universal Business Basic ran on those operating systems, but the Eclipse MV version of B32 continued to be sold while the MV line lasted. Some of the B32 Software staff in Blue Ash moved to Transoft's Atlanta, Georgia office. The New Zealand staff went on to found Binary Research.",Programming Language,1986,NA,NA,NA,1937,NA,NA,NA,40,0,B32 Software

Formula language,"The Formula language is a scripting language used by Lotus Notes. It is often referred to as @Formula language (pronounced at-formula) because many language elements start with the @-character. Here is an example of a selection formula:  SELECT @NoteId = ""NT0050D26""  It was created by Ray Ozzie during the early development of Lotus Notes. He borrowed the compiler and decompiler from the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, but unlike the spreadsheet language Formula Language was designed primarily for string and list processing, not numerical processing.  It was originally a Functional programming language with unique text list-handling features inspired by Ray Ozzie's prior use of Icon and Lisp. The Formula language engine was rewritten by Damien Katz for Notes and Domino 6. New features were added to the language, such as looping and dynamic execution, and performance was improved.The Formula language has two parts:  @Functions for calculations and simple logic @Commands for performing actions in the user interface@Functions can be used in several places throughout Lotus Notes. The most important uses are:  to select documents to show to the user in a view (a kind of index) or to select documents for further processing. In this case, the formula will evaluate to a 'true' (selected) or 'false' value (not selected) for each document. to provide default values for fields, to transform the data entered by the user (like stripping off redundant spaces) and to validate this data. to get a list of values from a Notes database or even from a relational database (using ODBC). This may be used to provide a user with a list of values to choose from. to process a set of documents. The formula is placed in an agent, a program or macro that can be started by a user or by the Notes server according to a schedule. When the agent is triggered, the formula executes for each selected document (this a very limited form of a loop). This is an efficient way of changing lots of documents, if the logic is not too complicated. In case of complicated changes, LotusScript is used.@Commands are like menu commands: they perform actions in the Lotus Notes client. Examples of actions are:  opening a Notes database creating an e-mail putting the cursor in a specific data-entry field closing a window starting an agent@Commands are primarily used in formulas that are triggered by user action, such as in button formulas. It is possible to combine them with @Functions, for example by making execution of an @command conditional on a field value.",Programming Language,1989,NA,https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSVRGU_9.0.1/basic/H_NOTES_FORMULA_LANGUAGE.html,https://searchdomino.techtarget.com/tutorial/What-is-Lotus-Formula-language,1941,NA,NA,NA,71,0,IBM

ScriptBasic,"ScriptBasic is a scripting language variant of BASIC. The source of the interpreter is available as a C program under the LGPL license. ScriptBasic generates intermediary code which is then interpreted by a runtime environment. ScriptBasic is available for Windows, Unix and Mac OS X and may be embedded in other programs as well. It can create standalone executable files. A runtime library is linked into the executable. It is available in precompiled binaries (setup.exe under Windows and uninstall also supported), dpkg and rpm for Linux and in source code form. The language, the interpreter is fully documented in the Users' Guide available in text, HTML, HTML Help, TeX, texi and PDF formats. ScriptBasic has been developed since 1999 and has reached a fairly matured state in terms of functions and stability. The precompiled version available for Windows and Linux includes a command line version and a standalone web server. This BASIC can be the choice for developers, who seek a BASIC variant that runs on UNIX as well as under Windows and Mac OS X (Intel). The Basic is embeddable with an option to compile your applications to a small footprint executable. ScriptBasic has an open interface for module developers. There are several external modules developed by the developer of ScriptBasic as well as by other developers. These include data base connection handling for various database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC, Berkeley DB and others), binding to the library CURL, PNG graphics, GTK+ graphical user interface, sockets, regular expressions, thread support, data compression and CGI. ScriptBasic also has an open interface for preprocessor developers. These are modules that may act not only during run-time but also compile time, thus making it possible to alter the language. Currently there is a single preprocessor that delivers debugger functionality. This lets the BASIC programmer run the BASIC program line by line, examine variable contents, set break points and all the usual debugging features. This debugger supports not only the command line version but also the web server implementation allowing full interactive debugging of CGI applications in BASIC. The architecture of the interpreter internally is object oriented and provides a clean and well documented interface to embed the interpreter into any application written in C or C++. The whole source code is extensively documented and commented, which is an outstanding feature compared to other embeddable script language implementations.

While originally conceived of as an interface to knowledge based systems, it was soon repurposed as an Agent communication language.Work on KQML was led by Tim Finin of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and  Jay Weber of EITech and involved contributions from many researchers. The KQML message format and protocol can be used to interact with an intelligent system, either by an application program, or by another intelligent system. KQML's ""performatives"" are operations that agents perform on each other's knowledge and goal stores. Higher-level interactions such as contract nets and negotiation are built using these. KQML's ""communication facilitators"" coordinate the interactions of other agents to support knowledge sharing.  Experimental prototype systems support concurrent engineering, intelligent design, intelligent planning, and scheduling. KQML is superseded by FIPA-ACL.",queryLanguage,1993,NA,NA,NA,1973,NA,NA,NA,65,0,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

In November 1985, Apple abruptly ended the project as part of a deal with Microsoft to extend the license for BASIC on the Apple II.  Although Apple retracted MacBASIC, unlicensed copies of the software and manual still circulated, but because MacBASIC was no longer supported by Apple and not designed to be 32-bit-clean, interest eventually died out. Benchmarks published in the April 1984 issue of BYTE magazine suggested that MacBASIC had better performance as compared to Microsoft BASIC. The language included modern looping control structures, user-defined functions, graphics, and access to the Macintosh Toolbox.

THINK C,"THINK C was an extension of ANSI C for the classic Mac OS developed by THINK Technologies; although named Lightspeed C in the original mid-1986 release, it was later renamed THINK C. THINK Technologies was later acquired by Symantec Corporation and the product continued to be developed by the original author, Michael Kahl. Version 3 and subsequent versions were essentially a subset of C++ and supported basic object oriented programming concepts such as single inheritance as well as extensions to the C standard that conformed more closely to the requirements of Mac OS programming. After version 6, the OOP facilities were expanded to a full C++ implementation, and the product was rebranded Symantec C++ for versions 7 and 8, now under development by different authors. THINK C (and later, Symantec C++) featured a class library and framework for Mac programming called the Think Class Library (TCL), which was used extensively for Macintosh application development. The Lightspeed/THINK C IDE was quite influential, though considered not as advanced as that belonging to THINK Pascal, its sister language product; it was considered the standard environment when MPW was considered an overpriced niche product, and most Macintosh products were developed in it for many years. With the transition of the Mac from 68K to PowerPC, however, Symantec was widely seen as having dropped the ball, and competitor Metrowerks's product CodeWarrior took control of the marketplace. Despite the decline in popularity of their IDE, Symantec was eventually chosen by Apple to provide next-generation C/C++ compilers for MPW in the form of Sc/Scpp for 68K alongside MrC/MrCpp for PowerPC. These remained Apple's standard compilers until the arrival of Mac OS X replaced them with GCC.

GUIDO music notation,"GUIDO Music Notation is a computer music notation format designed to logically represent all aspects of music in a manner that is both computer-readable and easily readable by human beings. It was named after Guido of Arezzo, who pioneered today's conventional musical notation 1,000 years ago. GUIDO was first designed by Holger H. Hoos (then at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany, now at University of British Columbia, Canada) and Keith Hamel (University of British Columbia, Canada).  Later developments have been done by the SALIERI Project by Holger H. Hoos, Kai Renz and Jürgen F. Kilian.  GUIDO Music Notation has been designed to represent music in a logical format (with the ability to render to sheet music), whereas LilyPond is more narrowly focused on typesetting sheet music.  The basic idea behind the GUIDO design is representational adequacy which means that simple musical concepts are represented in a simple way and only complex notions require more complex representations. [1]GUIDO is not primarily focused on conventional music notation, but has been invented as an open format, capable of storing musical, structural, and notational information. GUIDO Music Notation is designed as a flexible and easily extensible open standard. In particular, its syntax does not restrict the features it can represent. Thus, GUIDO can be easily adapted and customized to cover specialized musical concepts as might be required in the context of research projects in computational musicology. More importantly, GUIDO is designed in a way that when using such custom extensions, the resulting GUIDO data can still be processed by other applications that support GUIDO but are not aware of the custom extensions, which are gracefully ignored. This design also greatly facilitates the incremental implementation of GUIDO support in music software, which can speed up the software development process significantly, especially for research software and prototypes. GUIDO has been split into three consecutive layers: Basic GUIDO introduces the main concepts of the GUIDO design and allows to represent much of the conventional music of today. Advanced GUIDO extends Basic GUIDO by adding exact score-formatting and some more advanced musical concepts. Finally, Extended GUIDO can represent user-defined extensions, like microtonal information or user defined pitch classes.",textDataFormat,1998,Holger H.

Framework office suite,"Framework, launched in 1984, was the first office suite to run on the PC 8086 with the MS-DOS operating system. ValDocs, an even earlier integrated suite, actually comparable to the original Macintosh of 1984 and Apple Lisa of 1982 was produced by Epson, a complete integrated work station based on the previous Zilog Z80 processor and CP/M operating system with GUI and ""WYSIWYG"" typography on the monitor and printing. Framework offered all this however in the first all-in-one package to run on any PC platform. It was preceded by a few months by its close rival Lotus Symphony. Unlike other integrated products Framework was not created as ""plug-in"" modules with similar look and feel but as a single windowing workspace representing a desktop metaphor that could manage and outline ""Frames"" sharing a common underlying format. The initial release included about a dozen or so frame types (identified by a FRED function, @frametype). Frame types included containers which could be filled up with other frames, empty frames which could become other type of frames based on user input, formulas embedded in them or program output targeting them, word processor frames, flat-database frames and spreadsheet as well as graphic frames. Later versions included a frame type that can hold compiled executable code and the current version include an external type handled by separate applications running on the host operating system. Framework built-in interpreter, the FRED (Frame Editor) computer language, was based on Lisp and included an Eval function. It applied to all text and frame type across the product. Framework could be considered a predecessor to the present GUI window metaphor as well as integrated interpreters. The spreadsheet program was superior in its day, offering true 3D capability, where spreadsheets could form outline which can be ""opened"" to reveal a separate spreadsheet as well as other frame types—a feat of sheer convenient function never again seen and further enhanced in much later versions. Robert Carr and Marty Mazner founded Forefront Corporation to develop Framework in 1983. In July of that year, they approached Ashton-Tate to provide the capital and to later market the product.  Together with a team of six other individuals, Carr and company released the original Framework.  The product proved successful enough that in 1985, Ashton-Tate bought Forefront, a year sooner than planned. The original team, now working for Ashton-Tate, continued to enhance the product producing Framework II (1985), Framework III (1988-1989) and finally in 1991, the last Ashton-Tate's version, Framework IV.  Beginning with Framework II, the company also produced Framework II Runtime and Framework II Developer's Toolkit.  These products allowed application developers to create business applications using the built-in FRED programming language. Although Ashton-Tate humorously advertised that ""Lotus uses Framework"", Framework failed to gain more than a fraction of the market share needed to become a workplace standard. Lotus 1-2-3 was able to successfully capture most of the spreadsheet market and after a number of setbacks regarding Ashton-Tate's flag product, dBASE,  Borland bought Ashton-Tate and later sold Framework to Selections & Functions, Inc. Present versions include the FrameworkPascal compiler which extend Framework with Windows API. Framework works on most versions of Microsoft Windows. Framework 7 was the last version which can be run on Windows 95/98/ME or on DOS. Framework 8 and 9 only run on Windows XP. Beginning with Framework V (Framework 5), Selections and Functions introduced only a few features - mainly features required to prevent the office suite from becoming out-of-date. For example, Framework VII (Framework 7) introduced long file names, the Euro symbol and the ability to display pictures in Framework. Framework VIII (Framework 8) introduced the ability to display JPEG and .BMP files and to load such files into Framework databases. Of particular importance, all of the Selections and Functions' versions of Framework added the ability to share ""cut and paste"" (memory buffer data) between Windows and Framework. For detailed feature lists and screen shots see the Framework homepage listed below. Selections and Functions is nevertheless still selling Framework - although no price is available publicly.

Little Implementation Language,"LIL, the Little Implementation Language, was a system programming language during the early days of Unix history on PDP-11 machines. It was written by P. J. Plauger of Bell Labs. LIL attempted to fill the gap between assemblers and machine-independent system implementation languages (such as the C programming language), by basically adding structured programming to the PDP-11 assembly language. LIL resembled PL360 with C-like flow control syntax. The LIL compiler ""lc"" was part of Fifth Edition Unix (1974), but was dropped by Sixth Edition Unix (1975). Plauger left Bell Labs in the same year. Plauger explains why LIL was abandoned in Bell Labs in favor of C: [1] ... LIL is, however, a failure. Its stiffest competition at Bell Labs is the language C, which is higher level, and machine independent. Every time it looked like C was too expensive to use for a particular project, LIL was considered. But almost every time, it proved easier (and more rewarding) to improve C, or its runtime support, or the hardware, than to invest time in yet another language. ... A machine independent language is always superior -- even for writing machine dependent code (it's easier to find trained programmers) -- so long as the overhead can be endured. It is clear now that writing straightforward code and then measuring it is the formula for the best end product. At worst there will be 5-15 per cent overhead, which is seldom critical. Once system writers become mature enough to recognize this basic truth, they gravitate naturally toward machine independent SILs. ... it looks like the little implementation language is an idea whose time as come -- and gone.",Programming Language,1974,P.

SPITBOL,"SPITBOL (Speedy Implementation of SNOBOL) is a compiled implementation of the SNOBOL4 programming language. Originally targeted for the IBM System/360 and System/370 family of computers, it has now been ported to most major microprocessors including the SPARC. It was created by Robert Dewar and Ken Belcher, who were then at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Prior to the development of SPITBOL, SNOBOL4 was thought to be slow, memory-intensive, and impossible to compile due to its dynamic nature. While delayed binding prevents everything from being determined at compile time, SPITBOL adopts various strategies for making decisions as early as possible. Recent versions of the SPITBOL compiler are available. Since 2001 the source code for the original SPITBOL 360 compiler has been made available under the GNU General Public License. MACRO SPITBOL is an implementation of SPITBOL written in the 1970s by Robert Dewar and Anthony P. McCann. MACRO SPITBOL is coded in MINIMAL, an assembly language for an abstract machine. The instruction set is carefully defined to allow some latitude in its implementation, so that hardware operations favorable to string processing can be exploited. An implementation of MINIMAL that was designed for interpretation on microcomputers was done by translating MINIMAL into MICRAL using a translator that was itself implemented in SPITBOL. The MICRAL version of MACRO SPITBOL, together with the MICRAL interpreter ran in under 40K bytes. This extreme object code compression of MICRAL is achieved using a set of machine code macro substitutions that minimizes the space required for the object code and macro table. The complexity of known algorithms for an optimal solution to this problem are high, but efficient heuristics attain near-optimal results. The source code for MACRO SPITBOL was released under the GNU General Public License on April 17, 2009.",Programming Language,1971,NA,NA,NA,2082,NA,NA,NA,55,0,NA

RuleML,"RuleML is a global initiative, led by a non-profit organization RuleML Inc., that is devoted to advancing research and industry standards design activities in the technical area of rules that are semantic and highly inter-operable. The standards design takes the form primarily of a markup language, also known as RuleML. The research activities include an annual research conference, the RuleML Symposium, also known as RuleML for short. Founded in fall 2000 by Harold Boley, Benjamin Grosof, and Said Tabet, RuleML was originally devoted purely to standards design, but then quickly branched out into the related activities of coordinating research and organizing an annual research conference starting in 2002. The M in RuleML is sometimes interpreted as standing for Markup and Modeling. The markup language was developed to express both forward (bottom-up) and backward (top-down) rules in XML for deduction, rewriting, and further inferential-transformational tasks. It is defined by the Rule Markup Initiative, an open network of individuals and groups from both industry and academia that was formed to develop a canonical Web language for rules using XML markup and transformations from and to other rule standards/systems. Markup standards and initiatives related to RuleML include:  Rule Interchange Format (RIF): The design and overall purpose of W3C's Rule Interchange Format (RIF) industry standard is based primarily on the RuleML industry standards design. Like RuleML, RIF embraces a multiplicity of potentially useful rule dialects that nevertheless share common characteristics. RuleML Technical Committee from Oasis-Open: An industry standards effort devoted to legal automation utilizing RuleML.

Induction is inference from particular premises to a universal conclusion.  Abduction is inference to the best explanation. Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case.

S/SL,"The Syntax/Semantic Language (S/SL) is an executable high level specification language for recursive descent parsers, semantic analyzers and code generators developed by James Cordy, Ric Holt and David Wortman at the University of Toronto in 1980.S/SL is a small programming language that supports cheap recursion and defines input, output, and error token names (& values), semantic mechanisms (class interfaces whose methods are really escapes to routines in a host programming language but allow good abstraction in the pseudocode) and a pseudocode program that defines the syntax of the input language by the token stream the program accepts. Alternation, control flow and one-symbol look-ahead constructs are part of the language. The S/SL processor compiles this pseudocode into a table (byte-codes) that is interpreted by the S/SL table-walker (interpreter). The pseudocode language processes the input language in LL(1) recursive descent style but extensions allow it to process any LR(k) language relatively easily.  S/SL is designed to provide excellent syntax error recovery and repair. It is more powerful and transparent than Yacc but can be slower. S/SL's ""semantic mechanisms"" extend its capabilities to all phases of compiling, and it has been used to implement all phases of compilation, including scanners, parsers, semantic analyzers, code generators and virtual machine interpreters in multi-pass language processors.S/SL has been used to implement production commercial compilers for languages such as PL/I, Euclid, Turing, Ada, and COBOL, as well as interpreters, command processors, and domain specific languages of many kinds.

RenderMan Shading Language defines standalone functions and five types of shaders: surface, light, volume, imager and displacement shaders. An example of a surface shader that defines a metal surface is:  Shaders do the work by reading and writing special variables such as Cs (surface color), N (normal at given point), and Ci (final surface color). The arguments to the shaders are global parameters that are attached to objects of the model (so one metal shader can be used for different metals and so on).

DARPA Agent Markup Language,"The DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) was the name of a US funding program at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started in 1999 by then-Program Manager James Hendler, and later run by Murray Burke,  Mark Greaves and Michael Pagels. The program focused on the creation of machine-readable representations for the Web. One of the Investigators working on the program was Tim Berners-Lee and to a great degree through his influence, working with the program managers, the effort worked to create technologies and demonstrations for what is now called the Semantic Web and this in turn led to the growth of Knowledge Graph technology. A primary outcome of the DAML program was the DAML language, an  agent markup language based on  RDF.  This language was then followed by an extension entitled DAML+OIL which included researchers outside of the DARPA program in the design. The 2002 submission of the DAML+OIL language to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) captures the work done by DAML contractors and the EU/U.S. ad hoc Joint Committee on Markup Languages.  This submission was the starting point for the language (later called OWL) to be developed by W3C's web ontology working group, WebOnt. DAML+OIL was a syntax, layered on RDF and XML, that could be used to describe sets of facts making up an ontology. DAML+OIL had its roots in three main languages - DAML, as described above,  OIL (Ontology Inference Layer) and  SHOE, an earlier US research project. A major innovation of the languages was to use RDF and XML for a basis, and to use RDF namespaces to organize and assist with the integration of arbitrarily many different and incompatible ontologies. Articulation ontologies can link these competing ontologies through codification of analogous subsets in a neutral point of view, as is done in the Wikipedia. Current ontology research derived in part from DAML is leading toward the expression of ontologies and rules for reasoning and action.  Much of the work in DAML has now been incorporated into RDF Schema, the OWL and their successor languages and technologies including schema.org",xmlFormat,1999,NA,NA,NA,2162,NA,NA,NA,80,0,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

The language was robustly implemented and released to users from both industry and academia; up to 1,000 registered users were recorded in due course. The language, however, was only intended to provide a proof of concept for an experiment in persistent programming; some time after 1989 (the year the first implementation was in fact released) the group's interests moved on and the language was no longer maintained. Its influence lives on in various other systems however; the CORBA type ANY is distinctly recognisable in Napier88's type ANY; Microsoft's CLR uses a similar polymorphic architecture, and Java's parametric types solve some of the same problems of uninstantiated types escaping from their static scope.",Programming Language,1989,NA,NA,NA,2171,NA,NA,NA,45,0,University of St Andrews

Nested Context Language,"In the field of digital and interactive television, Nested Context Language (NCL) is a declarative authoring language for hypermedia documents.

In particular, NCL documents specify how these components are synchronized relative to each other and how the components are composed together into a unified document.  Among its main facilities, it treats hypermedia relations as first-class entities through the definition of hypermedia connectors, and it can specify arbitrary semantics for a hypermedia composition using the concept of composite templates. NCL is an XML application language that is an extension of XHTML, with XML elements and attributes specified by a modular approach. NCL modules can be added to standard web languages, such as XLink and SMIL. NCL was initially designed for the Web environment, but a major application of NCL is use as the declarative language of the Japanese-Brazilian ISDB-Tb (International Standard for Digital Broadcasting) terrestrial DTV digital television middleware (named Ginga).

SAM76,"SAM76 is a macro programming language used from the late 1970s to the present 2007 initially ran on CP/M. The SAM76 language is a list and string processor designed for interactive and user-directed applications, including artificial intelligence programming, and permits high portability from machine to machine. The language shares certain features in common with LISP, Forth, and shell programming languages of the UNIX operating system. Claude A. R. Kagan, the language's developer, sought to combine within a single interpretive processor, the characteristics of two different string and general-purpose macro generators and the provisions to embed multiple infix operator mathematical systems. SAM76 was designed to: be very pure syntactically and semantically; require a minimum of user keyboarding to achieve powerful results; fit in a very small computer system; permit editing, testing, and executing modules interactively; not prevent the user from doing strange things with the syntax of the language yielding, however, predictable results. The language was based around the idea of programming with macros. A user will define a macro (a code word that can be defined by the user to invoke a specific set of instructions to perform a routine within the program) to execute a set of instructions, usually in either machine or assembly language, and use the macro in the program. In this way, a user need only define a routine once and then when that particular operation, or string is required, the user can substitute is with the macro name. Since then the language has been rewritten in C and compiles on Windows, Unix, Linux, and similar operating systems. The source code is available online and still compiles and runs as of 2006.",Programming Language,1970,NA,NA,NA,2175,NA,NA,NA,45,0,NA

UNCOL,"UNCOL (Universal Computer Oriented Language) was a proposed universal intermediate language for compilers introduced by Melvin E. Conway in 1958. It was never fully specified or implemented; in many ways it was more a concept than a language. UNCOL was intended to make compilers economically available for each new instruction set architecture and programming language. Each machine architecture would require just one compiler back end, and each programming language would require one compiler front end. This was a very ambitious goal in 1961 because compiler technology was in its infancy, and little was standardized in computer hardware and software. The concept of such a universal intermediate language is old: the SHARE report (1958) already says ""[it has] been discussed by many independent persons as long ago as 1954."" Macrakis (1993) summarizes its fate:  UNCOL was an ambitious effort for the early 1960s. An attempt to solve the compiler-writing problem, it ultimately failed because language and compiler technology were not yet mature. In the 1970s, compiler-compilers ultimately contributed to solving the problem that UNCOL set itself: the economical production of compilers for new languages and new machines.  UNCOL is sometimes used as a generic term for the idea of a universal intermediate language. The Architecture Neutral Distribution Format is an example of an UNCOL in this sense.",ir,1958,NA,NA,NA,2186,NA,NA,NA,75,0,NA

Algebraic Logic Functional,"Algebraic Logic Functional programming language, also known as ALF, is a programming language which combines functional and logic programming techniques. Its foundation is Horn clause logic with equality which consists of predicates and Horn clauses for logic programming, and functions and equations for functional programming. ALF was designed to be genuine integration of both programming paradigms, and thus any functional expression can be used in a goal literal and arbitrary predicates can occur in conditions of equations. ALF's operational semantics is based on the resolution rule to solve literals and narrowing to evaluate functional expressions. In order to reduce the number of possible narrowing steps, a leftmost-innermost basic narrowing strategy is used which, it is claimed, can be efficiently implemented. Terms are simplified by rewriting before a narrowing step is applied and equations are rejected if the two sides have different constructors at the top. Rewriting and rejection are supposed to result in a large reduction of the search tree and produce an operational semantics that is more efficient than Prolog's resolution strategy. Similarly to Prolog, ALF uses a backtracking strategy corresponding to a depth-first search in the derivation tree. The ALF system was designed to be an efficient implementation of the combination of resolution, narrowing, rewriting, and rejection. ALF programs are compiled into instructions of an abstract machine. The abstract machine is based on the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) with several extensions to implement narrowing and rewriting. In the current ALF implementation programs of this abstract machine are executed by an emulator written in C. In the Carnegie Mellon University Artificial Intelligence Repository, ALF is included as an AI programming language, in particular as a functional/logic programming language Prolog implementation. A user manual describing the language and the use of the system is available.

CA-Realizer,"CA-Realizer was a BASIC-language software development product originally developed by Within Technologies, but first commercially released by Computer Associates, as CA-Realizer 1.0 in 1992. Several versions were released, that provided a version of the BASIC programming language, a Rapid application development tool, including forms building and some powerful built-in components, that was comparable to, and competitive with Microsoft Visual Basic, in its early days.  It offered some functionality (like a fairly useful spreadsheet) and cross-platform capability. There were versions for 16-bit Windows 3.1, 32-bit Windows 95, and 32-bit IBM OS/2.  The final version was CA-Realizer 3.0, released around 1996. As MS Visual Basic 4.0, and later continued to advance in functionality, CA-Realizer was left behind, and was quietly retired from CA's product offerings in the late 1990s.

NorthStar BASIC,"NorthStar BASIC was a dialect of the programming language BASIC originally provided for use on the NorthStar Horizon and NorthStar Advantage. The interpreter was written using only Intel 8080 instructions so that it could run also on custom systems.  One notable difference with other dialects of BASIC of the time was the array-like way in which strings were addressed. For example, A$(13,17) in NorthStar BASIC corresponded to MID$(A$,13,5) in other dialects. This string addressing technique is analogous to the one used in Fortran, and was also used in HP-3000 Basic and Atari BASIC.  Strings were allocated 10 bytes maximum length unless DIMensioned otherwise. It was still possible to use arrays of strings, but these were declared in two or more dimensions, for example DIM B$(10,50) created 11 strings (0-10) of maximum length 50 bytes. Input from the keyboard and output to the console and printers were treated in the same way as reading and writing to data files. Some other differences were that POKE became FILL, PEEK became EXAM, and INSTR became MATCH.Some other dialects of BASIC were created which were based on and inspired by NorthStar BASIC, such as Bazic (a rewrite of North Star BASIC taking advantage of the faster Zilog Z80 instructions), Megabasic and S.A.I.L.B.O.A.T. (a basic optimized for Z80 and X86 MS-DOS). Some of these were available for other hardware and operating systems, including Unix, CP/M and DOS.",Programming Language,1977,Charles A.

Actor,"The Actor programming language was invented by Charles Duff of The Whitewater Group in 1988. It was an offshoot of some object-oriented extensions to the Forth language he had been working on. Actor would be categorized as a pure object-oriented language in the style of Smalltalk. Like Smalltalk, everything was an object, including small integers. A Baker semi-space garbage collector was used, along with (in memory-constrained Windows 2.1 days) a software virtual memory system that swapped objects. A token threaded interpreter, written in 16-bit x86 assembly language, was the execution mechanism for compiled code. Actor only was released on the Microsoft Windows 2.1 and 3.0 operating system. Actor used perhaps the first pure object-oriented framework over native operating system calls as its basic GUI architecture. This allowed an Actor application to look and feel exactly like a Windows application written in C, but with all the advantages of an interactive Smalltalk-like development environment. Both a downside and upside to this architecture was a tight coupling to the Windows OS architecture, with a thin abstraction layer into objects. This allowed direct use of the rich Windows OS API, but also made it nearly impossible to support any other OS without a significant rewrite of the application framework.",Programming Language,1988,NA,NA,NA,2241,NA,NA,NA,70,0,The Whitewater Group

OCL is a well-developed constraint language that makes it attractive for use as an expression language. The intention was for GELLO to evolve as a standard query and expression language for decision support.GELLO creates the potential for many decision support options, as the full array of atomic patient data is greatly accessible to complement better, safer clinical decision making by health professionals. Furthermore, this enables specialist clinicians to customize their current systems and create flexible purpose built decision support systems.Standardization of GELLO it has made this language compatible with the HL7 version 3.0 Reference Information Model (RIM). GELLO uses an abstract ""virtual medical record"" (vMR) so that the same GELLO code can run on multiple systems accessing data stored in different formats.

IFPS,"IFPS (Interactive Financial Planning System) was a financial modeling language created by professor Gerald R. Wagner and his students of the University of Texas at Austin in the late 1970s. IFPS was marketed by Execucom, an Austin-based company started by Wagner. The company was acquired by Comshare in 1991.IFPS was available for a variety of platforms, including IBM mainframes (VM/CMS), DEC VAX, various flavors of Unix, DOS-based PCs and Macintosh Computers (named ""Mindsight""- running on two floppies). There were a number of versions, from about 1985,  including optimization and a data area for storing data separately from models. IFPS seems to have been an important inspiration for the Javelin financial modeling application. Some parts of the IFPS approach were later used by Lotus's Improv- like the separation of model logic and data. Difference to spreadsheet software (Lotus 1-2-3 and later Excel): Mainframe and PC/Mac versions of IFPS completely separated the logic model (connections between variables) and the data. Both were bound together by data placeholder (like ""earnings in Year1"" in the logic model - to easily run scenarios . (Spreadsheet) columns were represented by Name1, Name2, name3 etc. The model logic was written in lines with placeholder- oriented text ( ""earnings=sales-costs"" etc.). Comment lines on the model could be included anywhere with //. IFPS mainframe versions also allowed to simulate stochastic events by providing a range of probability distributions. The IFPS approach made it easy to communicate complex models even to laymen and managers. IFPS was eventually out-competed by spreadsheets.  IFPS was an essential financial model-development tool for long range planning and strategic planning, popular business practices in the 1980's.  As an ""English-like"" language, IFPS made it very simple to express relationships among financial concepts without having to worry about sequential logic, as the program would figure out dependencies among variables.  This allowed for simple creation of both financial and managerial accounting statements.   I was fortunate to work with IFPS for over ten years as an analyst at Champlin Petroleum aka. Union Pacific Resources.  I also attended seminars and conferences put on by Gerald Wagner and his team at EXECUCOM.   I believe it was the rise of risk management in the commodity industries over ""assumption-based"" techniques like long range planning, rather than spreadsheets per se, which contributed to IFPS loss in popularity.

Snowball,"Snowball is a small string processing programming language designed for creating stemming algorithms for use in information retrieval.The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball script (a  .sbl file) into either a thread-safe ANSI C program or a Java program. For ANSI C, each Snowball script produces a program file and corresponding header file (with  .c  and  .h  extensions). The Snowball compiler checks the consistency of its script, and this check was used to discover a typo in a seminal academic paper by Lovins which had remained undetected for 30 years.The basic datatypes handled by Snowball are strings of characters, signed integers, and boolean truth values, or more simply strings, integers and booleans. Snowball's characters are either 8-bit wide, or 16-bit, depending on the mode of use. In particular, both ASCII and 16-bit Unicode are supported. Like the SNOBOL programming language, the flow of control in Snowball is arranged by the implicit use of signals (each statement returns a true or false value), rather than the explicit use of constructs such as if, then, and break found in C and many other programming languages.The name Snowball was chosen as a tribute to the SNOBOL programming language, with which it shares the concept of string patterns delivering signals that are used to control the flow of the program.

Distributed Application Specification Language,"The DASL Programming Language (Distributed Application Specification Language) is a high-level, strongly typed programming language originally developed at Sun Microsystems Laboratories between 1999 and 2003 as part of the Ace Project.  The goals of the project were to enable rapid development of web-based applications based on Sun's J2EE architecture, and to eliminate the steep learning curve of platform-specific details. DASL defines an application as a domain model with one or more logical presentation models, where a logical presentation model consists of a choreography of the domain model objects described in a set of forms with attached actions.  DASL generates the graphical user interface directly from the logical presentation.  DASL is unique among modern application programming languages in its ability to generate a modern graphic user interface for an application without requiring the programmer to define the user interface explicitly, while allowing the programmer to control the look and feel of the generated graphic user interface. The DASL language is partially declarative and partially procedural. Description of object/data structures and persistence, and the description of the logical presentation, are declarative. Basic object constraints and behavior are declarative, while additional object behaviors are specified procedurally as methods. Queries can be defined either declaratively or by writing methods. The language and development environment are a practical realization of the model-driven architecture (MDA) approach. The programmer uses DASL to produce the platform-independent model or PIM, and the language code generators automatically produce and deploy the platform-specific model or PSM.

Smalltalk MT,"Smalltalk MT is an implementation of the Smalltalk programming language created in 1994 by Tarik Kerroum to deal with some of the shortcomings of Smalltalk-80 style of implementations. Smalltalk MT adopts a different approach in that the Smalltalk source is compiled to machine code before being executed. This allows the developer the freedom of working with compiled code without the need for the traditional compile-link-run cycle. This is like a specialized form of incremental or dynamic compilation. Smalltalk MT directly interfaces to DLLs in exactly the same manner as C which allows DLL calls to be tested directly in a Workspace, which allows a scripting style of approach to accessing any DLL based code. For example, one could write in a Workspace the following (single line or multiline, breaking on the '.' character) to reverse the string 'abc': a := 'abc'. WINAPI _strrev: a. a inspect. For 64-bit Windows , try: a:= 'abc'. WINAPI _wcsrev: a.  a inspect. The WINAPI call directly calls the DLL function _strrev natively passing parameters from the Smalltalk environment to the C environment and back. Smalltalk MT has a close integration with COM objects and fully compiled COM components can be created that operate in exactly the same way as C/C++ COM objects.

DIANA,"DIANA, the Descriptive Intermediate Attributed Notation for Ada, is an intermediate language used to represent the semantics of an Ada program. It was originally designed as an interface between the front end (syntactic analysis) and middle (semantic analysis) of the compiler on the one hand and the back end (code generation and optimization) on the other. It is also used as an internal representation by other language tools. DIANA is also used by PL/SQL, which is based on Ada. DIANA is an abstract data type; its concrete implementations are defined using the IDL specification language. DIANA descends from TCOL and AIDA, earlier representations of Ada programs. The Ada-0 subset of Ada at Karlsruhe (1980) was first using AIDA, but later AIDA got replaced by DIANA. The full Karlsruhe Ada compilation system used DIANA as well and the IDL External Representation for marshalling between the middle-end and the code generating back-end.",ir,1980,NA,NA,NA,2270,NA,NA,NA,35,0,NA
WSFN,"WSFN (Which Stands for Nothing) is an interpreted programming language for controlling robots created by Li-Chen Wang. It was designed to be as small as possible, a ""tiny"" language, similar to Wang's earlier effort, Palo Alto Tiny BASIC. WSFN was first published in Dr. Dobb's Journal in September 1977. The language consists primarily of single-letter commands to tell a robot to move in certain directions, while other commands perform tests or basic mathematical operations. These can be grouped into named macros to produce more complex programs. The original version also included code that simulated the robot as a cursor on the VDM-1 display, or graphically on a Cromemco Dazzler display. Today, this is known as turtle graphics. Extended WSFN is an implementation created for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers written by Harry Stewart and published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1981. In addition to supporting turtle graphics, it adds a number of commands to control the graphics and sound capabilities of that platform.

Tektronix 4050,"The Tektronix 4050 was a series of three computer graphics microcomputers produced by Tektronix in the late 1970s through the early 1980s. The display technology was similar to the Tektronix 4010 terminal, using a storage tube display to avoid the need for video RAM. They were all-in-one designs with the display, keyboard, CPU and DC300 tape drive in a single desktop case. They also included a GPIB parallel bus interface for controlling lab and test equipment as well as connecting to external peripherals. A simple operating system and BASIC interpreter were included in ROM. A key concept of the systems was the use of a storage tube for the display. This allowed the screen to retain images drawn to it, eliminating the need for a framebuffer, computer memory devoted to the display. Most systems of the era had limited resolution due to the expense of the buffer needed to hold higher resolution images, but this was eliminated in the 4050s and allowed the resolution to be as high as the hardware could handle, which was ostensibly 1024 by 1024 but limited by the physical layout of the screen to 1024 by 780. It also allowed the machine to dedicate all of its memory to the programs running on it, as opposed to partitioning off a section for the buffer. The first model, the 4051, was based on 8-bit Motorola 6800 running at a 1 MHz. It normally shipped with 8 KB of RAM and was expandable using 8 KB modules to 32 KB. The remaining 32 KB of address space was reserved for ROM, which could be expanded using two external ROM cartridge of 8 KB each. It included six character sets in ROM and an extended dialect of BASIC that included various vector drawing commands. The 4051 was released in 1975 for the base price of $5,995. Adding the optional RS-232 interface allowed it to emulate a Tektronix 4012 terminal.The second model was the 4052, which in spite of the similar name was a very different system. This had a CPU based on four AMD 2901 4-bit bit-slice processors used together to make a single 16-bit processor. It could also be used in a 6800-compatible mode, allowing it to run software from the 4051, although it did so much faster than the original 4051. Released in 1978, it came with a full 32 KB of RAM for $9,795, and could be expanded to 64 KB for another $1,995. The 4054 was a version of the 4052 built around the 19"" screen from the 4014 terminal rather than the 11"" screen from the 4012, increasing resolution to 4,096 by 3,072. External storage units were available for the 405x series computers. The 4924 was an external version of the internal DC300 tape drive. The 4907 used single or dual Shugart 851R 8-inch floppy drives with 64 KB floppies and the larger, 2-drawer filing cabinet sized, 4909 storage unit used a CDC 96 megabyte hard drive with the first 16 megabytes in the form of a removable disc-pack. Two sizes of the 4956 graphics tablet offered a slow process for inputing from paper drawings. The 4952 joystick was used for graphics input. Because the direct view storage tubes do not flicker as do conventional CRTs, and because the BASIC programming interface allowed simple, rapid rendering of vector graphic displays, the 405x series were used in many theatrical contexts.  In particular, 405x computers can frequently be seen in early Battlestar Galactica sets. The graphic display software was based upon software originally developed in the 1960s by Corning Glass Works for their Type 904 graphics terminal. The display for this system had characteristics to the similar to those of Tektronix storage tube display. It used small pixel regions composed of photosensitive glass, which could be darkened (forming a black line image) by writing, and would display this persistently until the entire display was erased. When Corning left the market this software base was sold to Tektronix. The original demo included an artillery game which was later adapted by high school students at Lindbergh High School in Renton, Washington to the HP 9830, and also adapted by Hewlett Packard for the HP 2647 intelligent graphics terminal demo tape and eventually similar games in Microsoft BASIC for the IBM-PC. Other games for the Tektronix included Weather Wars, with users directing lightning bolts and tornados against opponents in an environment affected by wind.",Programming Language,1980,NA,NA,NA,2303,NA,NA,NA,65,0,NA
Information Algebra,"The term ""information algebra"" refers to mathematical techniques of information processing. Classical information theory goes back to Claude Shannon. It is a theory of information transmission, looking at communication and storage. However, it has not been considered so far that information comes from different sources and that it is therefore usually combined. It has furthermore been neglected in classical information theory that one wants to extract those parts out of a piece of information that are relevant to specific questions. A mathematical phrasing of these operations leads to an algebra of information, describing basic modes of information processing. Such an algebra involves several formalisms of computer science, which seem to be different on the surface: relational databases, multiple systems of formal logic or numerical problems of linear algebra. It allows the development of generic procedures of information processing and thus a unification of basic methods of computer science, in particular of distributed information processing. Information relates to precise questions, comes from different sources, must be aggregated, and can be focused on questions of interest. Starting from these considerations, information algebras (Kohlas 2003) are two-sorted algebras                         (         Φ         ,         D         )                          {\displaystyle (\Phi ,D)\,}   , where                         Φ                          {\displaystyle \Phi \,}    is a semigroup, representing combination or aggregation of information,                         D                          {\displaystyle D\,}    is a lattice of domains (related to questions) whose partial order reflects the granularity of the domain or the question, and a mixed operation representing focusing or extraction of information.",Programming Language,1962,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7dca3656a5e3fc381ecd68eeb1e0fd4d90992076,2304,NA,NA,NA,65,0,System Development Corporation && Honeywell International Inc && RAND Corporation && IBM && United States Navy && National Cash Register Corporation && General Electric Company
PVS,"The Prototype Verification System (PVS) is a specification language integrated with support tools and an automated theorem prover, developed at the Computer Science Laboratory of SRI International in Menlo Park, California.  PVS is based on a kernel consisting of an extension of Church's theory of types with dependent types, and is fundamentally a classical typed higher-order logic. The base types include uninterpreted types that may be introduced by the user, and built-in types such as the booleans, integers, reals, and the ordinals.  Type-constructors include functions, sets, tuples, records, enumerations, and abstract data types. Predicate subtypes and dependent types can be used to introduce constraints; these constrained types may incur proof obligations (called type-correctness conditions or TCCs) during typechecking.  PVS specifications are organized into parameterized theories. The system is implemented in Common Lisp, and is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).",Programming Language,1992,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/50597508a9e76ed5cef6515b6bb107c8988c1e67,2305,NA,NA,NA,65,0,SRI International
Real-time Cmix,"Real-Time Cmix (RTcmix) is one of the MUSIC-N family of computer music programming languages.  RTcmix is descended from the MIX program developed by Paul Lansky at Princeton University in 1978 to perform algorithmic composition using digital audio soundfiles on a IBM 3031 mainframe computer.  After synthesis functions were added, the program was renamed Cmix in the 1980s.  Real-time capability was added by Brad Garton and David Topper in the mid-1990s, with support for TCP socket connectivity,  interactive control of the scheduler, and object-oriented embedding of the synthesis engine into fully featured applications. Over the years Cmix/RTcmix has run on a variety of computer platforms and operating systems, including NeXT, Sun Microsystems, IRIX, Linux, and Mac OS X.  It is and has always been an open source project, differentiating it from commercial synthesizers and music software.  It is currently developed by a group of computer music researchers at Princeton, Columbia University, and the University of Virginia. RTcmix has a number of unique (or highly unusual) features when compared with other synthesis and signal processing languages.  For one, it has a built-in MINC parser, which enables the user to write C-style code within the score file, extending its innate capability for algorithmic composition and making it closer in some respects to later music software such as SuperCollider and Max/MSP.  It uses a single-script instruction file (the score file), and synthesis and signal processing routines (called instruments) exist as compile  shared libraries.  This is different from MUSIC-N languages such as  Csound where the instruments exist in a second file written in a specification language that builds the routines out of simple building blocks (organized as opcodes or unit generators).  RTcmix has similar functionality to Csound and other computer music languages, however, and their shared lineage means that scripts written for one language will be extremely familiar-looking (if not immediately comprehensible) to users of the other language.",Programming Language,1992,NA,NA,NA,2306,NA,NA,NA,65,0,Princeton University && Columbia University && University of Virginia

SBASIC,"S-BASIC (for Structured Basic) was a ""structured"" BASIC variant, distributed with Kaypro CP/M systems.  It was made by Topaz Programming is distributed by Micro-Ap (San Ramon, CA).SBasic was compatible with the syntax of Basic, a programming language commonly used in the 1970s through the 1980s, as well as Fortran77.  However, the language relaxed many of the requirements of Basic and had more flexibility than Fortran.  For instance, line numbers were optional, and permitted non-numeric characters.  In addition, SBasic offered developers structured programming concepts, including recursion and nesting. Many PL-1 programs could be compiled with little modification, though SBasic did not offer an extensive function library. Among the more advanced features was the ability to ""base"" a variable or array, making the memory location dynamic and modifiable during execution.  SBasic programs had the ability to access memory areas reserved for the operating system unless prohibited from doing so by the operating system itself.  (Kaypro's CP/M had no such prohibitions.)  This enabled direct utilization and modification of DMA and other memory areas.  This feature also permitted a program to modify itself at run-time.  This capability also allowed modifying the instruction pointer, so a program could effectively link other executable modules that were read during execution as data. Unlike Basic interpreters that stored ""p-code"" that was parsed by an execution module, SBasic was a two-pass compiler, ultimately producing .com files that were executable.  The language was written in a subset of itself and compiled using a .com kernel, then stored on diskette (or hard drive on the last KayPro model).  The source was distributed with some KayPro models.  This encouraged open-source-like modification of the language, with some early pre-Internet user groups exchanging physical diskettes by regular mail.

Processors with the XS2 architecture include xCORE-200. The architecture encodes instructions compactly, using 16 bits for frequently used instructions (with up to three operands) and 32 bits for less frequently used instructions (with up to 6 operands). Almost all instructions execute in a single cycle, and the architecture is event-driven in order to decouple the timings that a program needs to make from the execution speed of the program. A program will normally perform its computations and then wait for an event (e.g. a message, time, or external I/O event) before continuing.",isa,2007,NA,NA,NA,2322,NA,NA,NA,60,0,NA

EUMEL,"EUMEL (pronounced oimel for Extendable Multi User Microprocessor ELAN System and also known as L2 for Liedtke 2) is an operating system which began as a run-time environment for the ELAN programming language. It was created in 1979 by Jochen Liedtke at the University of Bielefeld. EUMEL initially ran on the 8-bit Z80 processor, and was later ported to many different architectures. EUMEL is based on a virtual machine using a bitcode and achieves remarkable performance and functionality. Z80-based EUMEL systems provide full multi-user multi-tasking operation with virtual memory management and complete isolation of one process against all others. These systems usually execute ELAN programs faster than equivalent programs written in languages such as BASIC, Pascal, or Cobol and compiled into Z80 machine language on other operating systems. One of the main features of EUMEL is that it is persistent, using a fixpoint/restart logic.  This means that if the power fails you only lose a couple of minutes of work: upon restart you continue working from the previous fixpoint with all program state fully intact. This is also known as orthogonal persistence.  EUMEL was followed by L3 and later L4.",Programming Language,1979,NA,NA,NA,2325,NA,NA,NA,60,0,Bielefeld University

BEFLIX,"BEFLIX is the name of the first embedded domain-specific language for computer animation, invented by Ken Knowlton at Bell Labs in 1963. The name derives from a combination of Bell Flicks. Ken Knowlton used BEFLIX to create animated films for educational and engineering purposes. He also collaborated with the artist Stan Vanderbeek at Bell Labs to create a series of computer-animated films called Poemfields between 1966 and 1969. BEFLIX was developed on the IBM 7090 mainframe computer using a Stromberg-Carlson SC2040 microfilm recorder for output. The programming environment targeted by BEFLIX consisted of a FORTRAN II implementation with FORTRAN II Assembly Program (FAP) macros.  The first version of BEFLIX was implemented through the FAP macro facility.  A later version targeting FORTRAN IV resembled a more traditional subroutine library and lost some of the unique flavor to the language. Pixels are produced by writing characters to the screen of the microfilm recorder with a defocused electron beam. The SC2040 used a charactron tube to expose microfilm.  In BEFLIX, the electron beam is defocused to draw pixels as blurred character shapes.  Characters are selected to create a range of grayscale values for pixels. The microfilm recorder is not connected directly to the 7090, but communicates through magnetic tape.  BEFLIX writes the magnetic tape output on the 7090 and the film recorder reads the tape to create the film output.

Joe-E,"Joe-E is a subset of the Java programming language intended to support programming according to object-capability discipline.The language is notable for being an early object-capability subset language.  It has influenced later subset languages, such as ADsafe and Caja/Cajita, subsets of Javascript. It is also notable for allowing methods to be verified as functionally pure, based on their method signatures.The restrictions imposed by the Joe-E verifier include:  Classes may not have mutable static fields, because these create global state. Catching out-of-memory exceptions is prohibited, because doing so allows non-deterministic execution.  For the same reason, finally clauses are not allowed. Methods in the standard library may be blocked if they are deemed unsafe according to taming rules.  For example, the constructor new File(filename) is blocked because it allows unrestricted access to the filesystem.Cup of Joe is slang for coffee, and so serves as a trademark-avoiding reference to Java.

XDR was implemented in SQL Server 2000 and BizTalk Server 2000. Once the XML Schema Definition was finalized in 2001, Microsoft products and tools added support for it, and XDR was gradually phased out.

IITRAN,"IITRAN is a discontinued programming language created in the mid-1960s.  It was designed as a first language for students, and its syntax resembled that of PL/I.  The name derives from Illinois Institute of Technology, where it was developed. The IITRAN language was initially implemented on an IBM System/360 DOS system.  In the early 1970s, the IBM platform proved to be too small for the IIT environment and the hardware was upgraded.  A new version was developed for the Univac 1108 platform.  The language itself did not change but with the new hardware, a new implementation of the IITran software was developed. IITRAN was designed and developed in response to the increasing demand for a computer language which would meet the following specifications:  It should be clear, concise, and easily learned, even for those who have had no previous experience with computers or mathematics; It should bear as close a resemblance as possible to the English language; It should be free of awkward restrictions and limitations; It should be consistent with mathematical and logical foundations; It should allow processing of a great number of individual programs in a very short time; It should serve as a computational tool for students of science and engineering; It should process a clear, easily understood, set of diagnostic error messages.(Bauer, p. V) There was a Spanish language version of IITRAN at IIT as well. It utilized Spanish keywords rather than English ones.

Compact Application Solution Language,"Compact Application Solution Language (CASL) is a programming language used to create computer programs for Palm OS, and Microsoft Windows desktops, laptops, and Pocket PCs with Windows Mobile.  It is published by WAGWARE Systems, Inc., and Brainyware, LLC. As a language, CASL is similar to Pascal or Visual Basic with object-oriented programming features.  The CASL software development kit (SDK) includes a graphical user interface (GUI) forms editor, an integrated development environment (IDE), and a compiler.  CASL programs can either be run as interpreted applications on target devices (using a small helper binary), or compiled directly to native code (CASLpro).  One of CASL's key features is that the same source can be compiled to Palm OS, Windows, or Pocket PC with Windows Mobile, without changing the code, termed ""write once, run all"". In July 2005, CASLsoft announced they were discontinuing support for CASL and releasing it as freeware, with version 4.2 as the last official release.  A month later, WAGWARE Systems, Inc. and Brainyware, LLC announced the purchase of CASL, updated the product and continue to release it as commercial software.

Then the statement blitrect copies a region of an image into a changed region. When the OrigRegion and the new Region have different sizes, Final Cut Pro scales the image to fit into the new region. A Statement is a command that accomplishes a single action. In our example, the statements are scale and blitrect.

This is the same goal as HTML's separating CSS from HTML, moving away from <font> tags, but GRML takes it even further. One of the key aims in creating the format was to separate ""views"" of the data from ""forms"" used to manipulate it.

Concurrent METATEM,"Concurrent MetateM is a multi-agent language in which each agent is programmed using a set of (augmented) temporal logic specifications of the behaviour it should exhibit. These specifications are executed directly to generate the behaviour of the agent. As a result, there is no risk of invalidating the logic as with systems where logical specification must first be translated to a lower-level implementation. The root of the MetateM concept is Gabbay's separation theorem; any arbitrary temporal logic formula can be rewritten in a logically equivalent past → future form. Execution proceeds by a process of continually matching rules against a history, and firing those rules when antecedents are satisfied. Any instantiated future-time consequents become commitments which must subsequently be satisfied, iteratively generating a model for the formula made up of the program rules.",Programming Language,1993,NA,NA,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1716556a2336d202f6ddeaafd9566004e1a7673a,2497,NA,NA,NA,35,0,Manchester Metropolitan University

ObjectPAL,"ObjectPAL is short for Object-Oriented Paradox Application Language, which is the programming language used by the Borland Paradox database application (now owned by Corel).  Paradox, now in its 11th version, is a constituent of Corel's Word Perfect X3 office suite, for 32-bit Microsoft Windows.  The language is tightly-bound to the application's forms, and provides a very rapid and robust development environment for creating database applications for Windows.  ObjectPAL is not a full free-standing object-oriented language. It belongs to the family of languages inspired by Hypercard, with influences from PAL (wherever functionality could be kept the same), Smalltalk, and Garnet (a UI language created by Brad Myers).  While its objects do encapsulate source code, there is no support for polymorphism, and only a very limited inheritance concept, which is wedded to objects on a form which can be controlled by code placed on a higher object in a form's object hierarchy.  However, for what it is, ObjectPAL provides a wideranging and versatile language for creating Paradox applications.  The syntax and structure of the language resembles Visual Basic, but knowing Visual Basic would only help someone new to ObjectPAL in the sense that any other programming skill would be transferable to ObjectPAL.  ObjectPAL was the successor to PAL, which was the Paradox for DOS programming language.  With the advent of Paradox for Windows 1.0 in 1993, which was then owned by Borland Corporation, ObjectPAL was born. Version 1.0 was quickly succeeded by version 4.5 that same year. It can be used as such as a web server scripting language when combined with the Corel Web Server Control OCX, which implements a server API similar to the  CGI, and its standalone console, the Corel Web Server.",Programming Language,1993,NA,NA,NA,2500,NA,NA,NA,35,0,Corel Corporation

XMTC,"XMTC (for explicit multi-threading C) is a shared-memory parallel programming language.  It is an extension of the C programming language which strives to enable easy PRAM-like programming based on the explicit multi-threading paradigm.  It is developed as part of the XMT PRAM-On-Chip vision by a research team at the University of Maryland, College Park, led by Dr. Uzi Vishkin.  The philosophy of XMTC and the whole XMT project is that parallel programming is a hard intellectual task and the approach of building a hardware system first and then figuring out how to program them has not had much success.  For that reason a robust algorithmic theory and a reasonably easy hardware abstraction should be the specifications that guide how to build a new parallel architecture and programming language.  For parallel algorithms the algorithmic theory that has the largest body of literature is called PRAM (parallel random-access machine ).  This is not a coincidence, since PRAM is a natural way in which to think algorithmically in parallel.  In the early 1990s the PRAM model was deemed unrealistic because the hardware abstraction it was based on could not be implemented (because of low inter-chip bandwidth and high latency).  Now that multiple processors can be put on a single chip, these limitations are no longer present. The XMT architecture takes advantage of this excess on-chip real estate to implement a PRAM abstraction. The XMTC language is a modest extension of C and a work in progress.  The basic premise is that the programmer is responsible for exposing all the available parallelism.  While this sounds simple and many earlier approaches share this ideal, in practice, if the programmer defines too large a number of parallel tasks and the tasks are short, the program will perform very poorly. The way around that is to combine short parallel tasks into a longer one, which is usually the responsibility of the programmer.  In XMTC it is possible for the language to do that automatically, lifting the burden from the programmer. Software release of XMTC: PRAM-like programming allows experimenting with XMTC programming on standard computers.",Programming Language,1990,NA,NA,NA,2510,NA,NA,NA,30,0,NA

HTTP/3,"HTTP/3 is the upcoming third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to exchange binary information on the World Wide Web. HTTP/3 is based on previous RFC draft ""Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over QUIC"". QUIC is an experimental transport layer network protocol initially developed by Google. On 28 October 2018 in a mailing list discussion, Mark Nottingham, Chair of the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups, made the official request to rename HTTP-over-QUIC as HTTP/3 to ""clearly identify it as another binding of HTTP semantics to the wire protocol ... so people understand its separation from QUIC"" and pass its development from the QUIC Working Group to the HTTP Working Group after finalizing and publishing the draft. In the subsequent discussions that followed and stretched over several days, Nottingham's proposal was accepted by fellow IETF members, who in November 2018 gave their official seal of approval that HTTP-over-QUIC become HTTP/3.",protocol,2018,NA,NA,NA,2682,NA,NA,NA,15,0,Akamai

Klerer-May System,"The Klerer–May System is a programming language developed in the mid-1960s, oriented to numerical scientific programming, whose most notable feature is its two-dimensional syntax based on traditional mathematical notation.  For input and output, the Klerer–May system used a Friden Flexowriter modified to allow half-line motions for subscripts and superscripts. The character set included digits, upper-case letters, subsets of 14 lower-case Latin letters and 18 Greek letters, arithmetic operators (+ − × / |) and punctuation (. , ( )), and eight special line-drawing characters (resembling  ╲ ╱ ⎜ _ ⎨ ⎬ ˘ ⁔) used to construct multi-line brackets and symbols for summation, products, roots, and for multi-line division or fractions. The system was intended to be forgiving of input mistakes, and easy to learn; its reference manual was only two pages.The system was developed by Melvin Klerer and Jack May at Columbia University's Hudson Laboratories in Dobbs Ferry, New York, for the Office of Naval Research, and ran on GE-200 series computers.",Programming Language,1964,NA,NA,NA,2685,NA,NA,NA,15,0,Columbia University
Legal Knowledge Interchange Format,"The Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF) was developed in the European ESTRELLA project and was designed with the goal of becoming a standard for representing and interchanging policy, legislation and cases, including their justificatory arguments, in the legal domain. LKIF builds on and uses the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing concepts and includes a reusable basic ontology of legal concepts. The core of LKIF consists of a combination of OWL-DL and SWRL.LKIF was designed with two main roles in  mind: the translation of legal knowledge bases written in different representation formats and formalisms and to be a knowledge representation formalism which could be part of larger architectures for developing legal knowledge systems.",xmlFormat,2007,NA,NA,http://www.estrellaproject.org/?page_id=5,2686,NA,NA,NA,15,0,https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core/issues

SMILES arbitrary target specification,"SMILES arbitrary target specification (SMARTS) is a language for specifying substructural patterns in molecules. The SMARTS line notation is expressive and allows extremely precise and transparent substructural specification and atom typing. SMARTS is related to the SMILES line notation that is used to encode molecular structures and like SMILES was originally developed by David Weininger and colleagues at Daylight Chemical Information Systems.  The most comprehensive descriptions of the SMARTS language can be found in Daylight's SMARTS theory manual, tutorial  and examples. OpenEye Scientific Software has developed their own version of SMARTS which differs from the original Daylight version in how the R descriptor (see cyclicity below) is defined.",textDataFormat,1987,David Weininger,NA,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci00057a005,2689,NA,NA,NA,15,0,NA
